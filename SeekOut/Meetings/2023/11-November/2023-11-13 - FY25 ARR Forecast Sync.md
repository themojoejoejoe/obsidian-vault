# Agenda

Getting time on the calendar for us to work through the FY2025 ARR Forecast.
I will be in Bellevue this week, so feel free to join me in the office! We will work through the following assumptions:

- NEW ARR â€“ Recruit (# of Deals, ASP)
- Grow ARR - # of deals, ASP
- Expansion

- Expansion @ Renewal
- Expansion â€“ license expansion v product add ons; product add on # of deals, ASP

- Churn

- ARR up for renewal
- Terminated Customers
- Contraction @ Renewal

I would also love to back up these numbers with bottoms up forecasts originating from pipeline analytics

- Marketing funnel â€“ % of pipeline generated from MQLs, conversion rates & win rates
- Sales out bounding â€“ % of pipeline generated from MQLs, conversion rates & win rates
- Stage win / loss analysis (sales forecasting)

# Notes
- To walk through the high level assumptions on ARR forecast and how we want to address planning together
- High level guidance for leadership: we want to grow ~30% YoY
- Ask: 2 inputs
	- Number of MQLs by Month for the quarter, cohorted by enterprise & commercial
	- Review what we have for SALs - what was *just* salesprospecting vs marketing influenced
- Question: What are we going to improve?
	- Win Rates
	-
