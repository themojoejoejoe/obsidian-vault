- Chris:
	- Could be more commercial opps
	- The line for filling out MEDDICC when moving something through is $25K, so are people trying to get opps under that to squeeze things through?
		- read: "general laziness"
		- To fix that, it'd require Dan & Chris to go through each opp and look at it by employee size
- AEs going to give Chris a list of "things they think we don't have" and this will result in a list of thigns we either clarify we have, things we need to update, or things we need to create
- With RFPs, is there a way we can make content display to specific people


> [!todo] Action Items

- [ ] Howard to create report of SQLs last week sorted by Account Segment, Employee Size, and Amount to confirm if it's a MEDDICC dodging issue or just more commercial opps that are smaller
- [ ]
