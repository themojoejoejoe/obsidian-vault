## Experience Summaries (stay on target, joe)
#### Marketo + Bizible + Tableau implementation at SeekOut
* **Situation:** Similar to MuckRack, when I started at SeekOut there was no previous marketing operations function. We were using HubSpot primarily as an Email Service Provider and also for forms & landing pages. Our implementation was feature-limited and I knew we needed to either dramatically upgrade our level of services *or* identify a better alternative Marketing Automation Platform.
* **Task:** The first thing I needed to do was define requirements for what capabilities we needed from a MAP, as well as other capabilities like attribution and data visualization were needed by the business in the near term. Once I had those requirements, I needed to implement all of the above as quickly as possible so that we as a business could gain learnings and iterate accordingly.
* **Actions:** I developed a habit for drafting comprehensive narratives from my time at AWS, and I found this to be a constructive way to both capture comprehensive requirements as well as align with other stakeholders and leaders for feedback and ideas. This included data management, such as lifecycle and lead scoring programs, repeatable program templates to make marketing execution more scalable, and channel & campaign-level attribution capabilities.
* **Results:** Ultimately I recommended Marketo as the best MAP due to it's workflow management, as well as campaign operations capabilities, Bizible/Marketo Measure for attribution, and Tableau for data visualization. Drawing from my agency experience implementing over a dozen Marketo instances, I used all of that requirements documentation to help me write comprehensive workback schedules and advocate for resources; essentially I was able to say "I can do it this fast as a single FTE, this fast with an agency team with this level of spend, and *this* fast with a higher spend." 
	* As a result of all of that, I was successful in securing the medium-sized incremental investment in agency support had Marketo stood up and ready to use within ~3 months from receiving access and Bizible a few weeks after that.

#### Campaign Efficiency Improvement
* **Situation:** SeekOut's original definition of a Marketing Qualified Lead was limited to inbound demo requests, and they had been funding a paid media strategy that was essentially blind. We spent money because we knew paid ads results in an increase in inbound demo request volume, but at the time SeekOut lacked the tooling and expertise to be able to distinguish which demo requests originated from paid search plays and which were organic.
* **Task:** I needed to help the business quantify these as well as recommend optimizations to our paid search strategy.
* **Actions:** After implementing Bizible, I was able to clearly demonstrate and track with near-real-time accuracy how many MQLs came not just from specific channels, but also specific campaigns. Further, I was able to see which of these converted to pipeline, and ultimately, revenue. This helped me establish a baseline of what our current level of paid search spend was resulting in, and became the grounds for further experimentation. Given that our paid strategy was essentially blind, I recommended an approach where we cut spending by nearly 60% for ~2 quarters (specifically by defunding underperforming campaigns) to test the hypothesis that we could minimally improve our Return On Ad Spend to be 1:1 - meaning for every dollar we spend in paid search advertising, we can expect to get at least $1 back in revenue.
* **Results:** We slashed our spend, saving literally hundreds of thousands of dollars, and over the course of this experiment eventually did reach our goal.

#### ABM Implementation
- **Situation:** SeekOut had not intent platform of record and wanted to both add intelligence to sales outbound processes and develop account based marketing plays.
* **Task:** Define clear ABM platform requirements and recommend the ideal solution for SeekOut 
* **Actions:** 
	* Worked with marketing stakeholders to understand their planned strategies. 
		* Learned they wanted to use ABM as a means of database growth for records at accounts showing some level of purchasing intent.
		* Gained an understanding of what sort of keywords would signal purchasing intent. I.e. if someone was consuming content containing phrases like "internal talent management solutions" a certain number of times within a relatively short period, that was a strong signal that they may fit our ICP for a new solution we recently brought to market.
	* Drafted a requirements narrative and reviewed it with sales, marketing, and finance stakeholders for alignment.
	* Implemented 6Sense and integrated with SFDC, Marketo, & LinkedIn
	* Created an iframe dashboard in SFDC for all sales people to identify what their target accounts were doing as well as surface potential opportunities for intelligent prospecting. Enabled sellers to see accounts along an "awarness, consideration, decision" framework
	* Created orchestrations to grow our database with relevant titles from ICP accounts showing intent.
* **Results:** Grew our mailable database by nearly 20% in the first 90 days and increased Lead-to-SQL CVR from 26.7% to 64.1% in the first 90 days (average of 49.4%).
![[Pasted image 20240228185500.png|500]]
#### Churn Reduction
- **Situation:** Over the past year, our churn rate has reached as high as 60%. This is primarily due to economic downturn, as many companies are slowing or reducing hiring still, and as a result the opportunity for SeekOut products to drive value is becoming increasingly limited.
- **Task:** The primary focus across the entire business is to reduce this level of churn.
- **Action:** 
	- Integrated product usage data with Marketo via Snowflake & Workato
	- Rearchitected onboarding program from 7 emails containing basic one-size-fits-all documentation over 2 weeks to a 60 day program with dynamic content based on service usage (or a lack thereof).
	- Created a new internal metric, `Graduation Rate` and defined it as new customers who complete 4+ "high value actions" in their first 60 days.
		- My hypothesis was the faster we can create value for customers with the product, the stickier it will become and the more likely we'll be able to not only retain, but *expand* that customer.
	- Partnered with Customer Success team on building a parallel automation that enabled the customer to request help or conversation with their CSM.
- **Results:**


#### Scoring Optimization
- **Situation:**
    - SeekOut had no lead scoring model, resulting in arbitrary MQL targets. The initial setup led to a high volume of MQLs but a very low MQL-to-SQL conversion rate of 1.4%, eroding the trust between marketing and the SDR team.
- **Task:**
    - Overhaul the lead scoring model to improve the quality of MQLs sent to SDRs, thereby increasing the MQL-to-SQL conversion rate and rebuilding trust with the sales team.
- **Action:**
    - Partnered with marketing stakeholders to redefine what constituted an MQL, adjusting point values for behaviors and demographic tiers.
    - Implemented a modular lead scoring system that allowed for easy adjustments.
    - Collaborated with sales, marketing, and RevOps to ensure the new model met all teams' needs and expectations.
    - Launched a small-scale test to validate the new model before full implementation.
- **Result:**
    - Increased the MQL-to-SQL conversion rate from 1.4% to 12.8% within a year.
    - Reduced the average time from MQL to SQL by 13.8 days, speeding up the sales process.
    - Restored and enhanced trust with the SDR team, leading to their eagerness to partner on new marketing experiments and strategies.
    - Grew our mailable database by nearly 20% in the first 90 days and increased Lead-to-SQL CVR from 26.7% to 64.1% in the first 90 days (average of 49.4%).
- **Lessons Learned:**
    - Trust is earned through consistent, results-oriented actions.
    - Aligning sales and marketing through data-driven strategies and clear communication significantly improves team dynamics and business outcomes.
#### Self Service Licensing
1. **Situation:** "At SeekOut, we identified SMBs as a significant yet under-optimized revenue source due to high churn rates and labor-intensive onboarding processes."
2. **Task:** "My task was to devise a strategy that could automate the sales and onboarding process for SMBs, thereby reducing churn and labor costs while unlocking a new revenue stream."
3. **Action:** "To validate this idea, I spearheaded a cross-functional collaboration involving finance, marketing, engineering, and product teams. We launched a pilot by sending a secure link to a microsite for self-service purchasing to a pre-approved list of SMB prospects. This initiative required convincing leadership of its potential and meticulously planning the execution to ensure a secure and scalable solution." 
4. **Result:** "The initial response was highly positive, with 3 new deals won from a small, largely unengaged audience of 290 prospects. This success has led us to work on integrating this self-service option into our website, aiming to tap into a market potential estimated at over a billion dollars."
5. **Learning:** "This experience reinforced the importance of agility and innovation in product offerings and the value of cross-functional teamwork in executing new strategies. It highlighted the potential for technology to streamline operations and open up new markets, lessons I'm eager to bring to my next role."

## Questions for Brian
- What does success for this role look like from your perspective in the next 6 and 12 months?
	- For as mature as where they are, there's a lot of foundational building that probably should've happened earlier. Establishing the foundation is the must have in the first 6 months. 
	- Apart from Marketo, it's the entire lifecycle. What are those moments of truth and insights. Lead quality, lead distribution and conversion. How do we demystify that. TOFU understanding how conversion is happening.
	- Establishing analytics and insights foundation. There's a lot of data flying around but not a lot of insight. What are the 3 or 4 things we should be focusing on. 
	- Be more declarative about how we can answer:
		- Am I pacing appropriately in my segment?
		- Is my coverage what it should be?
		- How should it change in the next quarter?
	- Is pipeline coverage enough?
	- 6Sense & Attribution will need to be later add-ons.
- What's the most important KPI for this role from your perspective?
- How do you envision the collaboration between this role and other departments to drive revenue growth?
	- "Winning together" mantra
	- Needs to be a strong working relationship with revops and need to partner. Crisp RACI. Where does MOPs take the accountability?
	- Sales & SDR team need to be treated like a customer
	- Constructive dialoge about being aligned ot the right outcomes. Ownership is key.
	- What can we do to activate customers and improve retention.
	- People don't feel like it's us vs them. Gross retention, CW business, outcomes matter most
- What are the most significant challenges currently facing your team and how can this role help overcome them?
	- Improving churn QoQ for past 4 quarters, but improving gross and net retention. GRR is in the 80%s, but if we can move that up 4 to 6 points, it skyrockets our enterprise value from a rule of 50 or rule of 60 perspective. How do we get better.
- As the company scales, what changes or evolution do you anticipate for this role?
	- No COO, but there's a world where you get to 100M+ and you need to consolidate operations versus making it departmental. This will become more real as international expansions happen (planned for next 12 months).
	- Need to invest in a customer success platform (i.e. Gainside, Vitally, etc.)
- How has the approach to revops evolved in recent years, and what are the key focuses for the coming year?

## Questions for Erica & Teresa
1. Can you share more about how the company's values are reflected in day-to-day work?
	1. Teresa did a project on values and making sure they were consistently and fully integrated with mission. They have been since the beginning. All Muck Rackers live and breathe the values.
	2. Example: CEO & SLT would talk about every problem at the time. If we told everyone everything, no one would have time to do any work (information overflow). We are very targeted about sharing what employees need to know and at the right level of detail. Monthly all hands to go over major milestones and body of work. Updates through team meetings. To grow and evolve, they are targeted about how they share information.
	3. Kudos slack channel, every 2 weeks CEO selects 2 people to give props to based on core values.
	4. Weave into programs and practicies to make it authentic
2. What are the characteristics of succesful teams here, and how does the company foster collaboration?
	1. low ego spirit. Let's jsut figure it out and get the problem solve. Roll your sleeves up. SDRs will reach out to Ham and he makes time for the little details. 
3. How does the company support professional development and career growth for its employees?
		1.IN the last year have been developing career matrices and ladders. Use Lattice to track goals and identify requirements to move upwards. Review cycles annually for manager and employee (2-way). 2 promotion cycles annually to recognize people doing work. Coursera and other prof development platforms.
1. Can you tell me about the company's initiatives around diversity and inclusion?
2. How does the company support work-life balance?
	1. Because everyone works remotely, there's a natural sort of "work life integration." In addition, the value of ownership keeps people committed to the success of their teams and Muck Rack. If Greg continues to see positive results, he doesn't over reach about availability. You perform, you manage your life, you're fine.
