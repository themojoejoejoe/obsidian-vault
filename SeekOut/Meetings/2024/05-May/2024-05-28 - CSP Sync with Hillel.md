- Hillel POV â€“ with only 7 CSMs, we're going to need a CSP or similar tool.
- Hillel's proposal was to extend 6 months
- Wants to prove GRR impact
- "what's our customer journey?"
	- common refrain (Finance, Bryce, etc.)
	- Cass is developing
	- As a company we need to get to a single metric to understand how things are going. What's the point where a customer takes ownership of our data?
	- Hillel: maybe it's completing the export/project (note for later joe: this is too tactically focused)
		- Asked Cass & Jean to develop a go/no go metric to determine how we perform for our customers
