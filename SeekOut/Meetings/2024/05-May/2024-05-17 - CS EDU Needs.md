> [!note] Agenda + Notes
> Hey Will – I heard from Lauren C that you were looking for Admin access to YT. No issues there, but wanted to get on a quick call to 1/ set that up, make sure you get the level of access you need, etc., 2/ understand high-level  EDU needs for the next 1-2 quarters, and 3/ based on those, start planning out what reporting capabilities and any other mechanisms we may need to develop.

- Trying to understand from CS folks where they need the most help, what can be scaled/can't be scaled, and how do we go about the scaling?
	- i.e. live vs recorded training
- Plan to experiment with occasional live trainings and on-demand
- Who signs up, who attends, downstream effects of training
- doing a mixture of learning styles and trying to figure out what content works most
- Zoom has been working fine, but currently manual processes have been preventing reporting capabilities
- Dependencies on onboarding
- TBD on who owns the help center content
	- from the CS standpoing, what can we automate/scale
	- from a support standpoint, what can we give customers beyond Intercom?
	- Need to designate a technical content writer
	- There should be a backlog in [Jira](https://seekout.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/DOC/board) (there's an intake form for help center requests)
