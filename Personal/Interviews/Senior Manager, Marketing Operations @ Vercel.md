## Cory Gabor - Interview Notes
### Prep Notes
#### 1. Migration of Key Marketing Process
**Question:** Can you walk me through a time when you had to migrate a key marketing process, such as lead scoring or campaign management, from one platform to another? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?

**Response:**
"At SeekOut, I was tasked with building a scalable lead scoring system from the ground up, which closely mirrors the process of migrating a key marketing process to a new platform. The goal was to ensure that at least 13% of our MQLs would convert to SQLs, based on industry benchmarks I identified through third-party research.

**Step 1: Define Success Criteria:**  
I would start by setting clear success criteria for the new scoring model, such as a specific MQL to SQL conversion rate. This North Star will guide the entire project and help evaluate its effectiveness.

**Step 2: Familiarize with Salesforce Scoring Capabilities:**  
Since I’m not currently familiar with Salesforce’s scoring capabilities, I would first dive into the available documentation and perform hands-on exploration within the tool. This research spike would involve building sample automations to understand the platform’s scalability and limitations.

**Step 3: Align Stakeholders and Document Requirements:**  
Next, I would document the ideal state for the lead scoring model and align with key stakeholders across marketing, sales, and potentially finance. This document would outline how the scoring model will work, including specific scenarios that test whether a lead’s actions result in an MQL. This alignment ensures that everyone is on the same page before development begins.

**Step 4: Build and Implement the Model:**  
With the groundwork laid, I would proceed to build the scoring model in Salesforce, ensuring it meets the predefined success criteria and stakeholder expectations.

**Step 5: Monitor and Iterate:**  
Finally, I would establish regular check-ins to monitor the early data, analyze performance, and make necessary adjustments. This iterative approach ensures the scoring model remains effective and continues to drive qualified pipeline growth.

By taking these steps, I’m confident that I could successfully lead the migration and implementation of the lead lifecycle and scoring in Salesforce."

#### 2. Transition from Marketo to Salesforce
**Question:** Vercel is transitioning from Marketo to Salesforce for the lead lifecycle and scoring. How would you approach this migration, and what steps would you take to ensure it is successful?

**Response:**
"To approach the migration from Marketo to Salesforce for lead lifecycle and scoring, I would take a systematic and research-driven approach to ensure success.

**Step 1: Define Success Criteria:**  
I would start by setting clear success criteria for the new scoring model, such as a specific MQL to SQL conversion rate. This North Star will guide the entire project and help evaluate its effectiveness.

**Step 2: Familiarize with Salesforce Scoring Capabilities:**  
Since I’m not currently familiar with Salesforce’s scoring capabilities, I would first dive into the available documentation and perform hands-on exploration within the tool. This research spike would involve building sample automations to understand the platform’s scalability and limitations.

#### 3. Prioritizing High-Impact Projects
**Question:** How do you prioritize tasks when you have multiple high-impact projects like overhauling the lead intake process, improving forecasting, and managing a major platform migration?

**Response:**
"When managing multiple high-impact projects like overhauling the lead intake process, improving forecasting, and managing a major platform migration, my approach starts with detailed planning, clear communication, and strategic prioritization.

**1. Planning with Work-Back Schedules:**  
I begin by creating a work-back schedule for each major initiative. This includes a comprehensive overview of the project’s history, context, challenges, potential solutions, and my recommended approach. From there, I break down the project into component tasks, estimate the time required for each, and establish deadlines. This structured approach not only helps in planning but also provides a clear roadmap for execution.

**2. Strategic Prioritization:**  
When prioritizing tasks, I focus on those with the highest potential impact on the business. This involves evaluating each task’s alignment with strategic goals, its urgency, and the resources available. By focusing on high-impact tasks first, I ensure that we are driving the most value with our efforts. I also apply a philosophy of setting ambitious goals—aiming to achieve 80% to ensure we’re pushing boundaries while remaining realistic.

**3. Execution and Communication:**  
I execute these plans using project management tools like Asana or Wrike, which allow me to track progress and communicate effectively with stakeholders. Regular updates—whether weekly or bi-weekly—are shared with my team, my manager, and other relevant stakeholders to ensure everyone is aligned and informed about the project's status, any delays, and next steps.

**4. Monitoring and Adjusting:**  
Throughout the process, I monitor progress closely, adjusting plans as needed to stay on track or adapt to changing priorities. This includes regular check-ins and reviews to ensure that we’re meeting our deadlines and that our efforts are aligned with the broader organizational goals.

By following this structured approach, I’m able to manage multiple high-impact projects simultaneously, ensuring that we deliver maximum value and stay aligned with the company’s strategic objectives."

#### 4. Improving Processes in Marketing Operations
**Question:** Tell me about a time when you identified a process that needed improvement in your marketing operations work. What steps did you take to improve it, and what was the impact on the team or the organization?

**Response:**
"When I arrived at SeekOut, I noticed that we didn’t have any repeatable campaign or program template library in Marketo. Every time we launched a new initiative, the marketing team had to build all components from scratch—whether it was emails, program structure, or follow-up sequences. This lack of templates significantly increased the time required for execution, creating inefficiencies and slowing down our campaign delivery.

**Solution:**  
One of my first initiatives was to address this by working closely with the marketing team to identify our campaign-building needs for the upcoming year. We mapped out the types of programs we frequently ran and identified where templated assets could reduce production time. I then developed 8-10 Marketo program templates that included all necessary assets, such as emails, landing pages, and follow-up sequences. To further streamline the process, I implemented Marketo tokens, which allowed us to dynamically update content across multiple assets with a single change at the program level.

**Impact:**  
The introduction of these templates reduced execution time by 60-70%, allowing the team to build what previously took an hour in just 15 minutes. This improvement enabled us to scale our efforts, run more campaigns with fewer resources, and ultimately reach our customers more effectively. The templates also ensured consistency across our campaigns, contributing to a more cohesive brand experience."

#### 5. Ensuring Data Accuracy and Integrity
**Question:** How do you ensure data accuracy and integrity in your marketing operations, especially when dealing with large volumes of data from multiple sources? Can you share an example of how you handled a data quality issue and what steps you took to resolve it?

**Response:**
"I believe that ensuring data accuracy and integrity starts with a deep understanding of the systems you're working with. A recent example of addressing a data quality issue involved our use of Bizible for attribution tracking.

**Problem:**  
We encountered an issue where a significant portion of MQLs from a recent event did not get attributed to the event’s channel or campaign. This was unusual because we had a well-established process for offline channel attribution, which had worked reliably for years.

**Analysis:**  
Upon investigating, I discovered that we had deviated from our standard process by importing the attendee list twice—once before the event concluded and once after. This deviation caused the attribution touchpoints to be created incorrectly because Bizible was set to create touchpoints based on the campaign member’s creation date in Salesforce.

**Solution:**  
To resolve this, I modified the Bizible settings to create attribution touchpoints based on the ‘last updated’ date of the campaign member rather than the creation date. This adjustment corrected the attribution data and ensured that all MQLs were properly attributed to the event.

**Outcome:**  
This fix not only resolved the immediate issue but also restored confidence in our attribution data and processes. It reinforced the importance of adhering to established workflows and being vigilant about how even minor process deviations can impact data quality.

By thoroughly understanding the systems and quickly identifying the root cause, I was able to implement a solution that maintained the integrity of our data and the trust of our stakeholders."

---

#### 6. Balancing Short-Term Execution with Long-Term Goals
**Question:** How have you managed to balance short-term execution with long-term strategic planning in your previous roles?

**Response:**
"In the past, I’ve balanced short-term priorities with long-term goals by developing a clear and actionable roadmap that outlines a vision for the future and works backward from there. For example, when I first joined SeekOut, there was no existing marketing operations function or roadmap, so one of my first tasks was to create this strategic document.




### Interview Notes
- What I'm looking for 
- Lots of tech debt -
	- Tray issues
	- Product/lead intake
	- Enrichment - we get the data but don't enrich all the fields we could/should
	- lots of little things that accrue to big impact
- Hadn't used Tray before he got here, "fun to use"
	- Took a month or two to get up to speed on it
	- Huge event coming up, announcing reg on Tuesday
	- Intake process that should be straightforward and simple, but they work with engineering to ingest directly into tray, then SFDC
- Sam (SFDC admin) and Corey are the 2 primary builders
	- Renee even gets scrappy
- This role will sit on the Marketing Leadership Team to maintain focus and relationships with stakeholders
- Now shifting from organic "chaos" to scalable growth
- so much happens in slack
- How do you develop SOPs in COPs
- How do you currently manage your lifecycle
- how would you troubleshoot a situation
	- Gave bizible example
- MOPs doesn't do a ton of analytics, BI does everything in Preesa (sp?)
- Iron sharpens iron - hiring 1-2 more MOPs people and collaboration is important
- My questions to him:
	- What was your experience in your first 6 months
		- Previous Ops lead (no longer here) caused many struggles for GTM Ops function, mainly around showing the value of what Ops did or fight for the resources needed. Renee is the opposite: she's going to advocate for what she needs. From a MOPs perspective, Morgan was already asking what MOPs should be, what team structure should be like, etc.
	- Any cross-functional challenges I should be aware of?
		- Not really - biggest issue is bandwidth and pushing back. Very reactive previously - get ticket, go build. Corey has been pushing back on that and getting in on conversations earlier. Explaining in meetings we want to be part of these conversations, don't leave us out.

## Angelica Ismailos - Interview Notes
In this interview, we'll delve into your experience collaborating with leadership, developing and optimizing marketing processes, and leveraging data to drive decisions. You'll be asked to share specific examples of your work and how you've contributed to successful marketing initiatives.

### Prep Notes

#### 1. Collaborating with Leadership
#### 2. Campaign Optimization
* **Situation:** SeekOut's original definition of a Marketing Qualified Lead was limited to inbound demo requests, and they had been funding a paid media strategy that was essentially blind. We spent money because we knew paid ads results in an increase in inbound demo request volume, but at the time SeekOut lacked the tooling and expertise to be able to distinguish which demo requests originated from paid search plays and which were organic.
* **Task:** I needed to help the business quantify these as well as recommend optimizations to our paid search strategy.
* **Actions:** After implementing Bizible, I was able to clearly demonstrate and track with near-real-time accuracy how many MQLs came not just from specific channels, but also specific campaigns. Further, I was able to see which of these converted to pipeline, and ultimately, revenue. This helped me establish a baseline of what our current level of paid search spend was resulting in, and became the grounds for further experimentation. Given that our paid strategy was essentially blind, I recommended an approach where we cut spending by nearly 60% for ~2 quarters (specifically by defunding underperforming campaigns) to test the hypothesis that we could minimally improve our Return On Ad Spend to be 1:1 - meaning for every dollar we spend in paid search advertising, we can expect to get at least $1 back in revenue.
* **Results:** We slashed our spend, saving literally hundreds of thousands of dollars, and over the course of this experiment eventually did reach our goal.

#### 3. Process Optimization
##### Lead Scoring
* **Situation:** - SeekOut had no lead scoring model, resulting in arbitrary MQL targets. The initial setup led to a high volume of MQLs but a very low MQL-to-SQL conversion rate of 1.4%, eroding the trust between marketing and the SDR team.
- **Task:**
    - Overhaul the lead scoring model to improve the quality of MQLs sent to SDRs, thereby increasing the MQL-to-SQL conversion rate and rebuilding trust with the sales team.
- **Action:**
    - Partnered with marketing stakeholders to redefine what constituted an MQL, adjusting point values for behaviors and demographic tiers.
    - Implemented a modular lead scoring system that allowed for easy adjustments.
    - Collaborated with sales, marketing, and RevOps to ensure the new model met all teams' needs and expectations.
    - Launched a small-scale test to validate the new model before full implementation.
- **Result:**
    - Increased the MQL-to-SQL conversion rate from 1.4% to 12.8% within a year.
    - Reduced the average time from MQL to SQL by 13.8 days, speeding up the sales process.
    - Restored and enhanced trust with the SDR team, leading to their eagerness to partner on new marketing experiments and strategies.

- **Lessons Learned:**
    - Trust is earned through consistent, results-oriented actions.
    - Aligning sales and marketing through data-driven strategies and clear communication significantly improves team dynamics and business outcomes.

##### Full Spectrum Lifecycle
* **Situation:** When I arrived at SeekOut, there was no concept of a lead lifecycle. There were essentially 4 stages: 
		* Prospect/Lead
		* MQLs (demo requests)
		* Open Opportunities
		* Closed Opportunities
	* This was sufficient for helping SeekOut quickly ramp to $30M in ARR, but leadership was cognizant that a lack of process would not enable the same pace of business growth and scale.
* **Task:** My job was to recommend and implement a process.
* **Action(s):*
	* 
* **Result:**
#### 4. Leveraging Data to Drive Decisions
* **Situation:** 
* **Task:**
* **Action:**
* **Result:**
#### 5. Collaborating with stakeholders on complex project
“One example of cross-functional collaboration was my recent work on developing and deploying an account health scoring model for our customer success team at SeekOut. Our GRR had dropped to 55%, and we lacked mechanisms to predict which accounts were at risk of churn. My task was to create a model that could provide a clear, color-coded indicator of account health and alert CSMs accordingly.

I started by drafting a comprehensive narrative—a practice I learned at Amazon—to lay out the problem, background, and proposed solution. This document served as a foundation for aligning with the director of customer success, the program manager, and other stakeholders. Through an iterative process, we refined the model to focus initially on service usage, given the urgency of the situation.
  
Once aligned, I led the development of the model in Snowflake, integrating customer data from Mixpanel and visualizing the results in Tableau. Although it’s too early to measure the full impact on GRR, we’ve already identified that most accounts are in the red based on our criteria, highlighting the severity of the issue.

To ensure the project stayed on track, I set up an Asana board with a detailed work-back schedule and hosted weekly stand-ups to address any blockers. We managed to deploy the model two weeks ahead of schedule, demonstrating that taking time to align upfront can lead to faster execution in the long run. This ‘slow down to go fast’ approach is key to how I manage complex projects.”

This ‘slow down to go fast’ approach is key to how I manage complex projects.

#### **Transition from Marketo to Salesforce**

A strong example of ‘Iteration to Greatness’ in my work was when I tackled our upside-down return on ad spend (ROAS) at SeekOut. We were spending a dollar on paid search and social campaigns and getting back only about 50 cents in revenue—a clear indicator that our strategy needed refinement.

I used Bizible to analyze which campaigns were driving MQLs, pipeline, and revenue, and identified the underperformers. Based on this analysis, I recommended cutting 60% of our paid spend for a quarter, reallocating those funds to the high-performing campaigns.

As a result, our ROAS turned positive, and we started seeing a dollar spent return more than a dollar in revenue. Additionally, our MQL to SQL conversion rate improved from 12.4% to 14.6% year-to-date, showing that the MQLs generated were of higher quality and more likely to convert.

This process of analyzing, adjusting, and continuously monitoring our spend allocation allowed us to not only optimize our budget but also significantly enhance the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, aligning perfectly with the principle of ‘Iteration to Greatness.’

#### **Aligning Marketing Operations with Business Goals** 

The way I align marketing operations with overall business goals is through a biannual roadmap exercise, which I conduct in Q4 and Q2. This process begins with a clear understanding of the company’s top priorities, such as growing our new product, combating churn, and driving expansion. I draft a comprehensive roadmap that outlines the key initiatives my team will undertake to support these objectives, including implementing a customer success platform and delivering an account health scoring model to proactively manage at-risk accounts.

Once the roadmap is developed, I collaborate with stakeholders across product marketing, growth marketing, sales, finance, and customer success to ensure alignment and visibility. The roadmap includes not only the prioritized initiatives but also a list of dependencies and potential risks, allowing us to have open discussions about any challenges or resource gaps.

This roadmap then directly informs our quarterly OKRs, ensuring that our team’s efforts are consistently aligned with the company’s strategic goals. This approach has enabled us to stay focused on the most critical business needs while maintaining flexibility to adjust as priorities evolve.

#### **Vercel Values: Same Team**

A great example of Vercel’s ‘Same Team’ value in action was my recent collaboration with our Customer Success team to develop an account health scoring model at SeekOut. With our GRR at a troubling 55%, we knew we were losing significant revenue to churn, and our existing high-touch approach wasn’t scalable.

I proactively reached out to the Director of CS, proposing a model that would give CSMs a clear view of account health with simple green, yellow, or red indicators. This idea was well-received, and we quickly moved to define what metrics should be included, such as service usage, CSAT scores, and marketing engagement. 

I then wrote a comprehensive plan detailing the problem, proposed solution, and the necessary steps to implement the model. This plan was iteratively reviewed with key stakeholders, ensuring we had full alignment before moving forward. We ultimately decided to focus initially on service usage, building the model in Snowflake and integrating it with Salesforce and our customer success platform, ChurnZero.

Although it’s early, this model is already helping us identify at-risk accounts and understand the severity of the issue. It’s a prime example of how collaboration and shared ownership across teams can drive meaningful solutions to business-critical problems.

- “I’m currently making $200K base with a total compensation package that brings it between $210-220K. However, I’m really interested in the opportunity at Vercel and am open to discussing a package that reflects the responsibilities of this role and its potential for growth. I understand the base range tops out at $193K, and I’m confident we can find a compensation structure that works for both of us, perhaps through additional bonuses, equity, or other benefits.”

Morgan - get shit done mentality, are you just as much of a player as you are a coach?

## Morgane Palomares - VP Marketing
### Interview Notes
- MOPs started within RevOps
- Original RevOps leader left, which opened a gap with what we were going to do with the team
	- moved MOPs into marketing since Morgane had managed it before
	- Then Moved it back to REVOPs for centralization
	- Up until Renee arrive, the team/leadership wasn't "there"
		- This resulted in a change in marketing priorities:
			- we need to optimize declared intent funnel (turn handraisers to pipeline)
			- Diversity how we build pipeline
				- automated outbound
				- product led sales
				- spent Q1 & Q2 to build out but it was very MOPs heavy and no resources. So early priority potentially for this role.
		- Rolling out PQLs and PQTs (teams) + "fast tracked leads" that aren't quite PQLs & PQTs, but on the path to making it a predictable mechanisms
- Has not gone crazy on hiring yet but has the headcount for it
- Looking to MOPs to go from reactive to proactive, strategic partners
	- will get there via more self-serve programs (i.e. webinars, emails, etc.)
- Revamped lead lifecycle
	- starts with Suspect, then Inquiry, Created a SWL stage instead of actively working, etc.
- Hired first customer marketer and paying more attention to Chief Customer Success Officer to understand who owns expansion and nitty gritty decisions on how that all works
- CEO doesn't "quite understand RevOps"
	- he has opinions on the tools we use - gave an example of how we review tools and requirements
	- Use Koala (6Sense alternative)
-

## Ankur Chawa Interview

### Prep

#### Cross-functional Collaboration
**Account Health Scoring Model at SeekOut**

• **Situation:** At SeekOut, the company faced a declining Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) rate, which was around 55%. There was no clear mechanism for the Customer Success (CS) team to identify at-risk accounts, leading to potential churn.

• **Task:** You were tasked with developing an account health scoring model to provide real-time insights into account health, allowing the CS team to take proactive measures to retain customers.

• **Action:** You collaborated closely with the Customer Success team, data analysts, and marketing teams to gather necessary data and define scoring criteria. You organized weekly stand-ups and created an Asana board to ensure transparency and alignment across all stakeholders.

• **Result:** The account health scoring model was successfully deployed, enabling the CS team to prioritize at-risk accounts and take corrective action. This initiative highlighted critical at-risk accounts early on, setting a foundation for improved customer retention strategies.

**Implementing Bizible for Attribution at SeekOut**

• **Situation:** At SeekOut, there was no existing marketing attribution model, which made it difficult to measure the effectiveness of various marketing channels and campaigns.

• **Task:** You were responsible for implementing Bizible to provide clarity on which marketing efforts were driving results and to improve the accuracy of marketing attribution.

• **Action:** You worked closely with cross-functional teams, including finance, customer success, and sales, to align on goals, gather requirements, and ensure accurate data flow between systems. You established trust by fostering open communication and collaboration throughout the implementation process.

• **Result:** The implementation of Bizible provided precise marketing attribution, allowing for better decision-making and resource allocation. This also improved cross-departmental alignment and enhanced trust in marketing data.

#### Key Metrics and Attribution Models

**Optimizing Paid Spend at SeekOut**

• **Situation:** SeekOut was experiencing a negative return on ad spend (ROAS), where every $1 spent only returned $0.50 in revenue.

• **Task:** Your task was to identify underperforming campaigns and optimize the allocation of marketing spend to improve ROAS.

• **Action:** You leveraged a multi-touch attribution model using Bizible to analyze the full customer journey across different channels. You identified high-performing campaigns and reallocated budget to maximize their impact while cutting down on low-performing ones.

• **Result:** This data-driven approach turned ROAS positive and improved MQL to SQL conversion rates from 12.4% to 14.6%, enhancing the overall effectiveness of marketing investments.

**Revamping Lead Scoring Model at SeekOut**

• **Situation:** The existing lead scoring model at SeekOut was not effectively converting MQLs to SQLs, impacting pipeline generation.

• **Task:** You needed to develop a new lead scoring model to improve conversion rates and align with the company’s pipeline generation goals.

• **Action:** You analyzed historical data and incorporated third-party research to benchmark MQL acceptance rates. You crafted a scoring model that included various metrics such as demographic indicators, behavioral scores, and engagement signals to refine the lead qualification process.

• **Result:** The new lead scoring model led to a significant increase in MQL to SQL conversion rates, aligning with business objectives and enhancing sales pipeline quality.

#### Data Governance and Accuracy

**Data Integrity During Bizible Implementation**

• **Situation:** While implementing Bizible for marketing attribution at SeekOut, you identified a risk to data accuracy across CRM and marketing automation systems.

• **Task:** Your goal was to ensure data integrity and accuracy during and after the implementation process.

• **Action:** You established a data governance framework that included regular data validation, data entry rules, and frequent audits. You worked with both marketing and data teams to maintain consistent and reliable data.

• **Result:** These efforts maintained data accuracy, ensuring confidence in the attribution model and providing a reliable foundation for marketing decision-making and reporting.

**Resolving Data Discrepancies in Marketing Attribution**

• **Situation:** An issue arose during an event follow-up where MQLs were not correctly attributed due to unconventional list imports, resulting in misleading data.

• **Task:** You needed to resolve the data discrepancy and prevent future occurrences to maintain data accuracy.

• **Action:** You identified the root cause of the discrepancy, which was incorrect campaign member creation settings. You adjusted the attribution settings from “campaign member created” to “campaign member last updated,” which corrected the data flow and prevented similar issues in the future.

• **Result:** The adjustment restored data accuracy and confidence in the system, ensuring that future marketing attribution data would be reliable and actionable.

## Outline
*Topic: PLG Experimentation at SeekOut*
- **SeekOut & PLG (Introduction)** 
	- Prior to Q1 FY24, SeekOut 
		- had never experimented with PLG motions
		- Lacked a customer-facing webpage that clarified pricing or packaging options
	- ~61% of new opportunities created each quarter are in our SMB segment (fewer than 250 employees) with an average deal size of ~$8K.
		- Sales still has to complete the same approximate level of effort for any opp, regardless of size
			- Product Demo
			- MEDDICC criteria
			- General Opp/Relationship management
	- Customers in this segment also have the highest propensity to churn/return because hiring needs are cyclical.
- **Situation**
	- Primary Challenges
		- Lack of transparency in pricing/packages, resulted in many opportunities being created by prospects early in their evaluations, not ready to buy but wanted to see pricing & capabilities
		- High propensity to churn/return among companies fewer than 100 employees
		- High volume of SMB opps distracts sales from focusing on ENT opps (61% of opp volume, 20% of revenue)
	- Hypothesis
		- Automate the buying experience for SMBs will refocus sales on ENT deals without sacrificing revenue
	- Potential Impact
		- With a total addressable market of nearly 8M companies, the revenue potential for a motion like this could be up to $4M/year
	- Experiment Design
		- Test interest among companies with 100 or fewer employees (because generally the smaller the company, the higher churn risk)
		- Test $200/user/Month commitment vs $5-8K/year
		- Promote via email & select communities on social media & Slack
	- Success Criteria
		- P0 - Improve MQL to SQL Conversion Rate
		- P1 - Improve MQL to SQL velocity
		- P1 - Improve SQL volume
- **Task**
	- Create SeekOut-first Pricing page
	- Select & implement Self-Service Demo platform and experience
	- Partner with engineering on technical requirements for end-to-end flow
	- Create automations to support CX via MAP
- **Action**
	- SSD Platform + Experience
		- Drafted Requirements to align on with tiger team across product/engineering, marketing, and sales
		- Product Demos
		- Feature/Price comparison
		- Final recommendation: Storylane
	- Technical Requirements
		- Created high-level visualization to summarize backend flow for alignment
			- Requirements:
				- Not associated with an account with an open opportunity (`lifecycle stage` = `SAL` or `SQL`)
				- No existing user account (i.e. could not have churned before, had a free trial, etc.)
				- No freemail users – must be a business account
				- Fraud prevention
					- Enhanced verification
					- Limit access
					- Usage monitoring & automated alerts for potential bad actors
					- Legal & policy measures (ToS)
					- Other technological solutions to limit mass data scraping
			- Flow:
				- User experiences SSD and takes action on "Buy Now" CTA
				- User creates an account to login to a payment portal
				- User selects a package
				- User completes purchase with a CC
				- New customer data is synced across internal systems (Admin, SFDC, Snowflake, Marketo, etc.)
				- Automated user onboarding mechanisms follow SOP
		- Drafted detailed process documentation for dual-custody review, testing, and activation
	- Build
		- Marketo Program - Series of executable campaigns to prevent race conditions and enable consistent processing
		- Webhooks to send and receive information from our Admin system
- **Results & Learnings**
	- Results
		- 26 licenses sold
			- 53.8% ultimately churned, almost entirely after a single month
		- Negative ROI - $30K in 3P platform costs between Maxio & Storylane for only $16K in Revenue
		- - Only 562 webpage visits, 38 form submissions
			- Among people who visited webpage, CVR was 6.7%
		- Email strategy was unsuccessful: 35 visits but 0 conversions. This was primarily due to ~85% of the audience being cold (never engaged with SeekOut marketing before)
		- On a positive note, we noticed an almost 1% increase to visitor-to-MQL conversion rate with the self service demo experience vs the status quo
	- Lessons Learned
		- Scale & Transparency are P0s
			- Without transparent pricing, our ability to scale a PLG motion is limited to records in our database and records we can create via 3P sources, like ZoomInfo, 6Sense, et al. 
			- On-Page CVR has room to improve, but still a strong positive signal
		- PLG Motion = Good, Special pricing = bad
			- Making it easier for a high risk profile to churn has a predictable result
			- If this became standard, we'd immediately downgrade 50% of our SMB business
			- Risk of poor optics among customers
		- Action needed on Churn Reasons
			- Rather than restrict the process due to bad actor concerns, we should create the necessary monitoring safeguards to automatically disable accounts if nefarious activity is detected.
		- More Customer Intelligence needed
			- We've never run a survey program to gain more insights into why opps are lost (from the customer's perspective) or why customers churn. We have plausible/likely hypotheses, but we should reinforce these with 1P data, to the extent that we can get it.
			- Potentially research product updates/enhancements
		- SSD & Packaging Page are here to stay
			- Self-service demos are a positive customer experience, regardless of automated or high-friction buying cycle.
			- Packaging Page is continuing to drive high quality MQLs (in July we achieved an 18% MQL-to-SQL conversion rate, due in large part to MQL volume from demo requests originating from the packaging page.)

## Prep Notes with Rachel Nixon (Recruiter)

- G is not warm & fuzzy - will be super direct, no small talk
- Will ask about time at H2O and why I left after only 6 months
- Might touch on Vercel as a user and what my experience was like, so be prepared to chat through that and how it made the development process accessible to even someone teaching themselves how everything works on the job.
- This is most likely a gut check conversation, not a hard interview, so come ready to chat. It'll go fast and could cover a vareity of topics at medium depth.

### Questions
1. What are the most important things G is hoping to learn about me during this interview?


2. Is there anything from previous interviews that G will want me to expand on?


3. Is ther anything unique about G's interview style I should be aware of?


4. What do you think makes someone successful in this role at Vercel, particularly from G's perspective?


5. What can I do to best demonstrate alignment with Vercel's culture and values during this conversation?

## Prep
### Leaving H2O
When I joined H2O, I was really excited about the opportunity because the company was at a pivotal moment, redefining their technical foundation for marketing operations—everything from CRM setup to lead routing and marketing automation. Initially, it seemed like a great fit. 

However, as I got into the work, I encountered some communication challenges that slowed down critical projects, like streamlining lead routing to improve sales efficiency. Despite working closely with the RevOps team for those six months, it became clear that the environment wasn’t as collaborative or action-oriented as I needed to drive meaningful impact. 

Around that time, I was referred to SeekOut, which aligned better with my leadership style and offered a space where I could more effectively contribute and work cross-functionally.

More than anything, I’m looking to join a company where I can not only make an impact, but stay for the long haul. I want to be a key player in Vercel’s trajectory. I believe in the mission of shipping at the moment of inspiration, and I see exciting opportunities to expand who our customers could be—whether it’s developers or through the integration of AI. It’s an exciting time to join Vercel and be part of that future.

### Experience with Vercel as a User

A few years ago, I had hired a full-stack developer to help us migrate from a simple WordPress website to a more modern, scalable solution using React and Next.js with Contentful as the CMS and Vercel for the frontend. When that developer left for another opportunity, we didn’t have any internal resources or budget to support the site. This left me in a challenging position of needing to manage the technical side of our web operations.  

With no technical background, I had to teach myself the basics of web development—how to handle pull requests, create a local environment, stage builds, and run tests before shipping a PR. Vercel played a crucial role in making this manageable for me. It provided clear visibility into any build errors, helping me understand where problems were happening and how to fix them. Using resources like ChatGPT, I was able to troubleshoot and resolve issues confidently, even as a non-technical user.

The peace of mind Vercel gave me was invaluable. It’s designed in a way that makes it nearly impossible to break things unless you’re really trying, which was critical during this period. For someone with little experience, it was incredibly empowering to know I could manage the site without causing significant disruptions.

This experience sparked a deep curiosity in me about the technical side of things. I’ve since taken on personal projects, like building a React and Next.js portfolio site for my photography, all using Vercel. While I don’t expect coding to become a major part of my marketing operations role, Vercel has opened a door to exploring more technical areas, and I’ve become much more comfortable navigating the space between marketing and engineering.

This experience not only helped me fill a critical gap at SeekOut but also reinforced my belief that technology like Vercel can empower even non-technical users to manage and contribute meaningfully to technical projects. It’s this kind of curiosity and adaptability that I’d love to bring to Vercel as part of the team.

### How do you see Vercel's MOPs function evolving as we scale?

3 Key Areas:
1. Data-driven decision-making
2. Automation
3. Cross-functional alignment

To drive data-driven decision-making, we'll first need to build strong integrations across all platforms, with particular focus on Inflection and understanding our technical capabilities and limits of how we can leverage that platform to support PLG motions. We need to know how we can identify high intent signals based on user behavior and trigger the right experiences in the right channels at the right time. One way I've achieved this at SeekOut is by establishing a daily sync of limited service usage data into our Marketing Automation platform in order to support a given experience, like email, or define an audience for a campaign.

Second, automation and scalability are crucial. As user volume increases, we need to automate key touchpoints along the journey, from onboarding to expansion triggers, to ensure that every customer feels engaged without overloading internal teams. One recent example of how I've achieved this at seekout is an automation that sends demo requesters from companies with 100 employees or fewer to a self-service demo and ability to book a meeting with sales upon completion of that demo.

Finally, the Vercel MOPs team will need to work closely with product, growth, sales, and customer success teams to drive cross-functional alignment. This ensures we're all aligned on what's working, what's not, and where the opportunities lie. One example from my experience is how I'm currently leading a strategic operations project across SeekOut's GTM org to enhance operational rigor by establishing a biannual operational planning cycle across teams where all teams devleop their plans separately and then come together to finalize our roadmap as one.

By focusing on these 3 areas, I foresee Vercel's Marketing Ops function evolving into a strategic driver of growth, not just a support function. That's what excites me most about this role.
