# RAW NOTES
1. **Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility.** Why was it important? What was the outcome? 

Splash - hired in 2019 to build and manage content marketing program. She did that for about a year. At that time, they had 3 people on the demand gen team. All 3 left at the same time. VP asked if she'd be interested in expanding the scope of her role (she said yes), and that essentially became digital marketing and paid media for demand gen. 

Actions: She hired a marketing manager to manage technical setup and day-to-day management. Viewed her role as more of a guide for making sure the right messaging was out there, the marketing manager was setting up approrpriate tests. 

*Prompt: What was the outcome?*
Didn't have much to compare to because previously they weren't doing paid media. During the time she was there, she spent a lot of time on establishing benchmarks and optimizing from there. Things like making sure tag manager was set up appropriately for tracking pixels, etc. 

"I couldn't speak to specific numbers.. but what I can say is we reported on it biweekly at a revenue team meeeting and every week we saw growth in those areas." Both in terms of lead gen and anecdotal progress that all the technical things were set up properly.

2. **Describe a time when you didn't think you were going to meet a commitment you promised.** How did you identify the risk and communicate it to stakeholders? Is there anything you would do different?

No specifics, but "rally and make it happen."

At most recent role, was working for a startup doing a full rebrand. Renaming the business, visual brand updates, new website, etc. She had a large role in that process as managing the rebrand from a cross functional perspective and within the marketing team. 

With so many moving parts and workign with an agency, she felt like they were not going to be able to deliver the new website on time. 

Result: launched the website on time.

*Prompt: How did you identify the concern that the website might not deliver on time, and what action did you take to mitigate those concerns?*

She realized there could be an issue early on when they were doing wireframing with the agency. They weren't quite hitting the mark in terms of creative vision, visual appeal, etc. Agency would deliver something and "we" would have to redo a lot of that work. What can we do to take work off their plate? Identifying ways they needed to support them more. 

3. **Tell me about a time when you saw a peer struggling and decided to step in and help.** What was the situation? Why did you decide to step in? What actions did you take?

Not a peer, but from a manager/employee perspective at Paylocity, Rebecca was leading the payments team. One of her first hires was someone managing internal events. That person had a lot of internal stakeholders to keep apprised and "happy" and there were quite a few situations with this person where she struggled because leaders in charge of the areas where she was planning events were expecting different themes or activities with the events (differences of opinions between leaders).

Action: Rebecca helped her events person do more deeper dives on the front end to gather requirements and explore what was important to those people. 

*Prompt: Did that help with how she navigated those differences of opinion?*

Yes, it created stronger relationships across teams/departments and turned the situation from people being reluctant to working with her to a full reverse course.

4. **Tell me about a problem you had to solve that required in-depth thought and analysis.** How did you know you were focusing on the right things? What was the outcome? Would you have done anything differently?

When she was working at Splash, COVID hit. No in person events. Prior to that the whole value prop was around the value of inperson events and why face to face interactions were important.

The product team had already been working on a virtual event solution, but prior to COVID there was no urgency (it was an add-on outside their core business). There were a lot of event marketing companies doing the same thing then, so they had to figure out how to differentiate and prove why Splash was better.

One of the things "we" came up with was the event marketers had to become experts in something new. From a marketing standpoint, that meant she had to become an expert in their needs and challenges. She and head of Product Marketing warroomed for several days to brainstorm GTM strategy. "Part of it was us being in a room riffing making decisions with our gut, and part of it was talking with customers and doing 1P research." They used the content of these interviews to generate content to help customers understand how to remain successful with virtual events in COVID. They partnered with VIMEO and that helped build credibility. They then investigated hybrid events knowing those were "here to stay"

*Prompt: Would you have done anything differently?*

"I don't think so." Rebecca said the content performed well and generated the number of leads they needed. Anecdotal feedback from customers was great. I'm sure there were things that could be improved but nothing stands out.
