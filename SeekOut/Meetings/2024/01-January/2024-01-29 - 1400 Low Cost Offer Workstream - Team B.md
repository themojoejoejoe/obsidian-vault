* VM: create CC experience in product and not on the public-facing website for the MVP
	* Requirement: ability to take experience down with no customer-facing changes
	* All technical requirements are already built into the product
* TaxJar - we discussed as this is not a "smart" sales tax engine and not the right tool for this use case
* VR: we don't want CS to have to support, manage admin 

Potential for a 6Sense Orchestration - create segment, add to Campaign, trigger email
