 ðŸ“– IMPORTANT NOTES: If you find yourself have trouble forming the dough from it being too sticky, start by adding the flour first then slowly add the yogurt & mix it together. 

Depending on the yogurt brand some contain less or moisture than others causing it to be stickier. If this happens slowly add more flour until you reach a consistency you can work with & make sure to add some flour to your hands as well.
