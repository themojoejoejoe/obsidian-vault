- Mike: wants QBR deck as a template they can just screenshot to "take and go"
	- solve for majority so we can focus on details with one-off cases
- Daily Agg is a subset of all the mixpanel data based on criteria we set. All mixpanel data is in snowflake.
- Need to have things that not tracked on the daily agg table currently to be set up to be tracked in mixpanel and then pulled into the daily agg table
- Need to figure out which column B metric names are not currently solved in Tableau
