# Recruiter Interview Prep
Hi Joe,

That is great to hear! At this time, I would like to move forward to the first step of the interview process! Below is information on the interview steps and what to expect. I have also included attachments that outline our leadership principals and a worksheet to help you prepare. 

Here is a link that I highly recommend reviewing to learn more about AFP. [https://shipping.amazon.com/](https://shipping.amazon.com/ "https://shipping.amazon.com/")

Also, some specific tips for this role should you get to the phone screen; 

1. Use examples that showcase **highly complex** projects and results. The examples should not be 1 or 2 days transactional task but should require a lot of stakeholders, and require high efforts. **We do not want high level overviews, but detailed and concise examples**. **This team is looking for PROBLEM SOLVERS. How are you assessing risk and mitigating them in your execution? How are you innovating and providing solutions for your customers? What factors/metrics/data points are you looking at to decide if something is working or not? We want folks who can help build the plane while flying it.**
2. **One of the problems you will be expected to solve in this role is to use KPIs to track and improve growth and retention in customers using Amazon Shipping. Think of examples where you have done something similar.** 
3. Functional lifecycle marketing is a critical skill set, so prepare examples that showcase this skill. 
4. **Some of the most important Leadership Principals for this role are, Hire & Develop the Best, Deliver Results, Dive Deep and Invent and Simplify. The interviewers will also want to hear how you have hired and grew a team around a problem statement.** 
5. Be sure to explain the result and impact of your examples. **Any example without quantifiable impact is not well received.** 
6. Show your ability to work autonomously - how did you influence without an authority? What mechanisms did you have? How did you use metrics and monitoring to push your stakeholders in the right direction? 
7. Working in ambiguity and the ability to take initiative and be a creative problem solver is also important to this role. 
8. **Articulating your answers with the STAR method.**

What should I expect? 

You should expect to complete phone interview. If you are inclined from the phone interview, you will move to a second phone interview and if inclined from there, you will be invited to a virtual final interview. The phone interview will be 45-60 minutes to complete and the final interview will be 4-6 hours virtually. The virtual onsite will be the same format as the phone screens. You will meet with 4-6 members of the hiring team, individually for 45-60 min interviews. *

Let’s get started!

To schedule the first step, you will receive an automated email within the next couple days from our coordinating team requesting your availability for a 45-60 minute phone interview with a member of the hiring team. The email will come from the alias [amazon-stores-na-nontech-ps@amazon.com](mailto:amazon-stores-na-nontech-ps@amazon.com "mailto:amazon-stores-na-nontech-ps@amazon.com"). You may consider adding this email to your contacts to avoid the email landing in a spam, junk or filtered folder. Please respond to that email immediately upon receiving it and provide as much availability as possible to ensure timely scheduling. Please be mindful of the time zone that you list. Once your interviewer confirms, you will receive a follow-up email confirmation with the details of your interview. Please reach out to your Recruiting Coordinator with any scheduling/logistics questions**. * Please note that you may not hear from the scheduling team for a 3-4 days after providing your availability. They are working to find an interviewer with matching availability and will reach out when they have a confirmed interviewer. I do not have any visibility into scheduling so if you need an update, change interview times, or have any questions regarding scheduling, please reach out to the email address above.***

How Should I Prepare?

The phone interview will consist of behavioral/situational-based questions as they relate to the Leadership Principles as well. These are our guiding principles, so you will want to think about how you have applied these throughout your career. Be sure to use specific examples and be able to discuss the situations in detail. I suggest having at least 2-3 examples per Leadership Principal prepared. You should structure your response using the STAR method – STAR is an acronym that stands for Situation, Task, Action and Result. Remember, Amazon is a data-driven company, so any examples where you can showcase your ability to lead or influence with data, are value-add. Please be prepared to share about yourself and your work experience. Don’t be afraid to tell a story. Please use “I” statements, as opposed to “we”, to accurately illustrate your direct contributions. We want to understand how you think, so explain your thought process and decision making throughout the interview. Please prepare some questions for the interviewer to showcase your interest in the role. Here are some great resources to help you prepare to interview at Amazon and a great article that describes Amazon’s Leadership Principles in more detail.

Should you be inclined from the phone interviews and are invited to the final interview, the virtual onsite, the client lead recruiter, Reshma, will then invite you to a group prep call where you can bring any general questions you may have regarding the virtual onsite.

## Launching EPS
**Situation:** Over the course of my tenure at AWS, marketing grew from a central team of ~20 people to a decentralized marketing organization of over 1500 people. Because channels like Paid Search, Social, and Organic website traffic were managed by central teams and email was self-service, this often meant that marketers tended to overly rely on email as their primary marketing channel. As the number of Marketo users grew, it became increasingly common that audiences would overlap from one campaign to another. Due to email governance policies my team had established, this often resulted in marketers being unable to reach their targeted audiences reliably. 

**Task:** AWS required a scheduling tool that could automate email prioritization so marketers could have greater transparency and predictability regarding how much of their target audience they could expect to reach with a given message. I needed to gather requirements for this tool and secure the necessary resources to build and maintain it.

**Action:** First, I led the initial requirements gathering exercise to define what this service would need to do and considered how it would work. I designed a solution that required the marketer to first create targeting parameters by performing an action they were already familiar with: building a Marketo Smart List. This would then inform the service *who* they wanted to target, assess what other campaigns an individual qualified for on a given day, if any, and prioritize which campaign would be delivered based on some other input. My initial idea was to incorporate machine learning to prioritize campaigns similar to those a person had previously interacted with. The service would then add a "reserved audience" into a static list in the appropriate Marketo program, making it clear to the marketer not only *how many* people they would be able to reach, but exactly *who* as well.

With the solution roughly sketched out, my next task was to secure the engineering resources required to build and maintain this system. I drafted a PRFAQ to establish a vision for what this 1st party Email Prioritization Service could look like. The main selling point was that this service could enable greater customer obsession in our outbound marketing by incorporating machine learning to make email prioritization unique to each individual based on emails they've interacted with in the past. After reviewing this with our L8 and CMO, I was able to work with our internal engineering team to secure dedicated resources for this project.

Once we had built an MVP, I needed to find someone to test it out and provide feedback before I could launch this service. I approached our APAC field marketing team with this proposal, making it clear that we may encounter some bugs along the way but this tool would essentially enable them to view and even override the service's prioritization for campaigns reaching into their geographic market. I reviewed with them how our Marketo program templates would need to be modified to work for EPS, as well as how to add campaigns to the system for prioritization. It took us about a year to work through bugs and other scheduling issues, but otherwise the system was ready for global launch.

In chatting with our director of data science and engineering, I found one thing I hadn't considered was that we had not proven that this service "did no harm." We didn't construct any A/B testing to measure email performance among a prioritized cohort compared to the status quo of "whoever we could get at the time." To achieve this, I approached our EMEA field marketing team and proposed a quarter-long test where their campaign builders would utilize both systems: the email prioritization service and the old method of scheduling. As you'd expect, because target audiences were still the same at their core, email performance was flat between both approaches. So I had successfully proven that the email prioritization service did no harm and was ready to launch globally.

**Result:** After launching the service and training our stakeholders on how to use it, we received vastly positive feedback that marketers were better able to understand their audiences pre-send and also more reliably reach their audiences. Campaign owners also appreciated that if their campaign *did not* receive significant prioritization, there was exception request process where my team could review their business justification and manually adjust email prioritization accordingly.

Additionally, because marketers no longer had a reason to resort to overly broad targeting tactics, overall channel performance improved significantly in EPS' inaugural year. Click through rates increased 47 BPS from 1.69% to 2.16%, which at the time was an all-time record for the email channel and only 4 BPS short of the 3P benchmark for Tech. Our unsubscribe rate remained healthy at 0.18% (2 BPS better than benchmark .20%)




# Key Leadership Principles

## Hire & Develop the Best
- *Describe a time you constructed a team to accomplish a goal*
	- SeekOut MOPs
	- **Situation:** When I arrived at SeekOut, there was no existing Marketing Operations function or expertise. 
	- **Task:** Hire 3 individuals to scale Platform Operations, Analysis, and Website Operations to build the technology and process infrastructure to enable the business to scale and deliver improved pipeline & revenue.
	- **Actions:** I leveraged a combination of my personal network and SeekOut's own product to identify SMEs along these disciplines. I recruited a former colleague from AWS as a frontend developer and website operations manager, a Marketo Certified expert with both startup and enterprise experience configuring systems for centralized and decentralized execution (respectively), and a data analyst with skill sets in Tableau and SQL.
	- **Result:** Within my first year at SeekOut, I led my team to deliver:
		- Implemented Marketo, Marketo Measure, Tableau, 6Sense, and Splash
		- A mall directory of Tableau dashboards aligned to a matrix of questions Marketing was accountable for answering
		- Migration of website CMS from Wordpress to Contentful, saving ~$300K in investment relative to Heap (Our marketing VP had a connection with their CMO and my direct report and I met with them to understand how they managed their CMS migration to Contentful and resources required. We then determined what we could do in-house)
		- Establishment of repeatable program templates and QA process that resulted in achieving SeekOut record email performance benchmarks (99%+ deliverability
		- 
		- 
		- 
		- versus 80%, 2.5% CTR and 0.20% unsubscribe rate)
		- Channel, Subchannel, and Campaign-level attribution resulting in marketing contributing to $28.9M in pipeline with a detailed view of how much each individual component contributed to that amount.

*- Tell me about a time when you had a low performing individual on your team.*
	- Adam, Program Manager of AWS Newsletter
		- **Situation:** In my previous role as team lead for AWS Email, I noticed that one of my team members, Adam, was consistently sandbagging in his role. His primary responsibility was to curate and send weekly release notes to AWS customers. He was reliable in completing this task every week, but never went beyond the basic requirements. In fact, he had agency support for most of the email building so his primary work was simply bar raising and scheduling the weekly email.
		- **Task:** My objective was to motivate Adam to not only fulfill his job duties, but to also seek ways to contribute more significantly to our projects and the team's success. 
		- **Action:** To achieve this, in one of our regular 1:1s I began by affirming his reliability and consistency, which are valuable traits for any role. Then I shared my observation that he had the potential to contribute more substantially and asked if there were any barriers preventing him from taking more initiative that I could help unblock. What I learned in this conversation was that Adam had a desire to become more involved in creating and managing lifecycle campaigns. While my team didn't have direct ownership of any established lifecycle campaigns, I connected him with our Global Campaigns team as a dedicated bar raiser for their ongoing nurtures, and set a goal for him to optimize those campaigns to improve event registrations by 10% and improve email performance metrics to meet or exceed our standard benchmarks (that amount to a ~30 BPS increase to CTR and reducing unsub rates by 5 BPS). 
		- **Results:** This sort of leaning in sort of had "unlocking" effect on Adam. It was almost as if he just needed the permission to get involved with another program and the rest was all him. He made a recommendation to implement a simple opt-out link that would stop the nurture series from continuing to send to a given individual versus them unsubscribing completely, and that actually led to an 8 BPS decrease in unsubscribe rate, making that program achieve a 0.17% unsubscribe rate. At the time I left AWS, he had also improved overall CTR for this program by 17 BPS, which was short of the goal but directionally a marked improvement. *After* I left AWS, Adam stuck around for an extra year or so and eventually reached out asking if I'd be willing to be a reference for him to take a dedicated lifecycle manager role at Workiva. I said of course, gave him a glowing recommendation, and he got the job, where he still works today.
## Deliver Results
*- It can be difficult to set goals for a team that are challenging, yet achievable. Tell me about a time when you hit the right balance.*
	- Arriving at SeekOut, setting MOPs 12 month roadmap + 3 year vision
		- Complete MAP migration within 3 months
		- Complete Attribution platform configuration within 4 months
		- Create reporting infrastructure and establish data visualization tool + self-service reporting capabilities (Tableau)
		- Create repeatable program templates for decentralized execution
		- Establish & maintain bar raising process for campaign QA
		- Integrate Service Usage data with marketing automation systems

*- Tell me about a time when you did not effectively manage your projects and something did not get completed on time.*
	- Integrating service usage data in SeekOut marketing automation systems.
		- **Situation:** there was no service usage data consumable in any sales, marketing, or customer success system. Outbound campaigns were one-size-fits-all and linked to generic how-to documentation that wasn't necessarily relevant to a given customer's use case.
		- **Task:** I needed to create the business case for the necessary technologies, establish vision of internal use cases, and workback schedule, and deliver this capability.
		- **Actions:** I drafted a business case to establish a Data Warehouse using Snowflake that would enable us to 1/ create a single source of truth and 2/ create a central repository for accessing & utilizing data from disparate systems (i.e. SFDC, Marketo, SeekOut products, etc.). I drafted and presented a narrative of how we could use service usage data to identify and mitigate churn risks via our internal customer nurtures, estimating an initial impact of reducing churn by between 17% and 23% (this amounted to $2-2.7M in business impact). Finally, I integratetd Workato with Snowflake and Marketo and created the Custom Objects and Recipes to move that data in a daily automated job.
		- **Results**: We've only had these capabilities for a little over 3 months, so while it's a little too early to celebrate, we're seeing some encouraging signals from early indicators. As a result of my work overhauling our adoption nurture campaign to "graduate" new customers by instigating 4 key product behaviors, we've seen a 27% lift to our Monthly Active Users compared to the previous quarter


## Dive Deep  

- *Tell me about a time when you had to validate the assumptions underlying a direct report's project.*
	- Email Template Redesign at AWS.

- *Have you ever created a metric that helped identify a need for a change in your department?*
	- MQL Acceptance Rate at SeekOut

## Invent and Simplify

- *Tell me about a time when you enabled your team to implement a significant change or improvement.*
	- Attribution data at SeekOut improving ROAS from negative ROI to $2 in pipeline for every dollar we spent
		- **Situation:** Prior to my arrival, SeekOut lacked a marketing operations function and had no way of understanding how marketing spend translated to new opportunities.
		- **Task:** I needed to architect channel and subchannel definitions and implement the required technology to track attribution.
		- **Action:** Leveraging a best practice approach I had implemented at another company, I drafted a narrative proposal that made the business case for procuring an attribution platform and established channel and subchannel definitions. 
		- **Result:** For the first time, SeekOut gained the ability to understand how individual marketing efforts across channels and specific campaigns contributed to pipeline. This enabled the team to optimize their ad spend by reducing
