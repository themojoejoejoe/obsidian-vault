- VR Feedback
	- Need someone who knows they can manage different points of view and shape/influence them for the right results
	- Need good instinct on optimization - how do maximize results for set of pages (example)
		- I.e. really passionate about metrics
	- There's a lot of variability in talent. Makes sense to have someone in India do that initial screening
		- Loop follows after
	- $20k/year in India
	- Whoever is in the more technical position should be more data informed and passionate about improving step-by-step
	- Target tecnical resource: React Developer
	- PLG - best way to get alignment is during quarterly planning process
		- put it in the discovery phase for Q4
