- Hillel summarized restructure/RIF and purpose to get to break-even cashflow
	- intensified the need to narrow focus and how we address customer base
	- we need an official customer journey supported by a CSP
	- mentioned competitors think we're paying too much for CZ
- Michael (CZ): Are there specific things you're looking for to create that customer journey?
	- Hillel: We want to map out "what would a successful customer/user look like by end of the year" so we can leverage this info to support a successful renewal.
		- We know this will be better if we have a CSP that can track the behaviors of a user/account
		- ~700 tech touch and ~300 high tough (CSM-driven)
	- Cass: Evaluated TeTango & Vitally, Pricing is ~30% of CZ
		- also mentioned the capability to automate QBRs (tool doesn't necessarily do this by itself, this is important for the "good usage" project)
	- Michael: "Success plans" on our roadmap
		- standardized templates for QBR decks
		- automation & insights with AI on the roadmap for this year too
- Hillel: Cass, you mentioned how painful it can be with data siloed from different objects. CZ team, how have you helped other customers overcome that?
	- CZ spoke about identifying high value contacts at a given account (this is going to require configuration on our end)
	- *Many of the platform concerns being raised are related to a lack of configuration and/or clear requirements on our side*
		- i.e. how to identify customers not on track for renewal, what is license utilization in TT vs High Touch? Breaking down user and account data on a dashboard
- Joe: Are some of these concerns related to data siloing a CZ platform limitation, or something on our side to fix regarding integrations?
	- Kerry Finley (CZ): these are primarily things we haven't "finished" together (read: not platform limitations)
- CZ to get us quote by early next week
