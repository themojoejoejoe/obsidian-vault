In a world so divided by personal beliefs this is going to sound silly, but the better part of success in the corporate world is simply having an informed point of view. What's wild is that you don't even have to be *right*; you just need to be able to explain why you support your ideas and why others should too. If you get good enough at this simple practice, you'll find yourselves rapidly ascending any org chart. Truly, it's madness!

I once worked for a CMO who I often disagreed with. I was always polite and professional in how I raised those disagreements (see also "*Candidly Indefatigable*"), but perhaps in moments of consternation she would often ask "Okay, in my shoes, what would you do differently?"

My brothers and sisters in {{lead.preferred-deity:default=Christ}}, these moments are opportunities. If someone asks you what you think they should do, one of two things is happening:

1. They genuinely want to know your opinion
2. They think you don't understand and want you to stay in your lane

The thing is, it doesn't matter which one is their motivation. There's a good chance in either scenario that if you can answer the question clearly, rationally, and without ego or malice, they might actually take your advice. Smart leaders know they don't know everything and that diversity of thoughts and views leads to better outcomes; dumb leaders want to take credit for other people's smart ideas. Both roads lead to the same destination, but *only if you have a strong point of view strongly supported.*
