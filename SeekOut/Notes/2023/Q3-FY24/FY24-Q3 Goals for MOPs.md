## Repositioning Goals More Strategically
The above goals support our overarching objectives, but don't create strategic areas of ownership or support a broader vision. The tasks themselves are worthwhile, but would better benefit each owner if they laddered up to a more longterm plan. Those higher level plans then become the goals we hold ourselves accountable for while the individual tasks represent data points towards achieving those goals.
