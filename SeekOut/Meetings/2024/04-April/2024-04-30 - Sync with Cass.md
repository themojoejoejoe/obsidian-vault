- Gap with ChurnZero isn't emailing capability but instead is data silos
	- account level data
	- user data
	- opportunity level data
- Been focused more in the last 30 days on things to focus on
- Success:
	- *No usage plays* - campaigns for users that haven't logged in in a certain amount of time. Creating FOMO of everything they're not getting by using SeekOut
		- related to the $3M in ARR. 27% of users we reached out to logged back in and were still active 6 months later
