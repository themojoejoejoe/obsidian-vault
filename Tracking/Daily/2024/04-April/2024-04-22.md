# Ian 1:1
- Upcoming priorities
- Recurring challenges
- Career goals

- Identify gaps in lack of usage in specific product feature
- Decisions from data are "are the customers using the products?"
- Sean is more focused on big picture, Ian is more focused on "are cusotmers using the products they're paying for, who is using it, etc." - Arms the CSM for the QBRs
- 1 project he's attempted a few times and been unsuccessful: "what does good usage look like?"
	- 4 iterations of benchmarking to compare industries, company sizes, ARR
- We had Falkon and "no one gave a shit" when it said that people were a churn risk, no one did anything. Was highly inaccurate.
- Most dashboards are built with single customers in mind. Opportunity to build overall product usage trends
- Need for an MBR with CS involved around usage
