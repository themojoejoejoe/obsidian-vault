- Automations in place that save AE time but don't compromise the business (i.e. what we made last year)
* **Automated Demo Scheduling**
	* Under 100 from International - give storylane demo flow
		* Popup: are you really going to spend $6-10K? If yes, book time with sales
		* We made like $100K in the last 12 months from this segment, so safe place to test

- Marisa & SDR team to prospect into customer base. 
	- Will focus on 700 tech touch customers

* In product
	* Make every button available to customers for every feature, followed by a message like "you don't have access to this, talk to your salesperson"
	* Route to SDRs*
