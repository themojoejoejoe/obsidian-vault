- Experimenting with users & behaviors to increase engagement, reduce churn. Method of doing this is pushing them into high value actions
- 1st thing: people who have done searches and have an integrated ATS, but haven't done searches leveraging the ATS. "If you did the same search in your ATS, you'd get more people, and here's a sample set"
- Beep Beep - product owned service that can send emails
- Cass: 
	- How do we identify which customers have with products?
		- i.e. not all users that have ATS export have rediscovery. So logistical concern is how do we ensure we're sending these to the right users?
			- Alistair: leaning on product folks to find a way to identify features available to given accounts with the product team. (may need to pull in Alison Hartle)
- Ideal launch date of first test is "ASAP"
