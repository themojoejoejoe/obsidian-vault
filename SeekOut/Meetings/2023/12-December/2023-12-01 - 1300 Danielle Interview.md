- **Tell me about a time when you didn't know what to do next or how to solve a challenging problem.** How do you learn what you don't know? What were the options you considered? How did you decide the best path forward? What was the outcome.

Something she had not experienced as a marketing manager was the go to market lane of lifecycle marketing. Her product had a new feature launch and the feature itself was pretty much an entirely new product that in many ways was similar to other products that they had already offered. She had ~1 year to define strategy and execution of this GTM plan that would eventually lead into the evergreen customer acquisition plan for the product.

To get started, she set up regular standups with stakeholders - product, sales, sales enablement, brand marketing, and other PMM teams. First step was to dive into the data to look at the different population segments - here are all the possible advertisers we could email in the database and let's do this in a tailored way based on the segment they're in. For example, an advertiser who was already launched onthe existing product and launched on another advertising product that was considered similar to her launch. So she tested a "better togther" value prop of message of keeping both. 

From there, she worked backwards on timeline goals, developed a workback schedule, Looping in stakeholders, creating a RACI chart, etc. 

Ultimately it was successful: they used internal attribution models to know these emials caused incremental new launches. After 1 quarter  (after the excitement died down) she continued to see positive results for this new feature compared to pre-existing emails before.

* **Tell me about the most exciting automated lifecycle nurture you've worked on.** What made it exciting? What was the goal? What was the result?

One thing that was really exciting to work on was on the retention side - D launched a "campaigns defects" program in Email and the Ad Console UI. What she saw was high rates of attrition on ad products within 1-2 weeks in many cases. This was because advertisers couldn't see their attribution until they hit 14 days of usage, but were getting frustrated and quitting early (whether they realized that or not). 

To reduce attrition, Danielle investigated *why* advertisers were attritioning. What she found was there was a high incidence of campaigns with "defects" - meaning best practices weren't being followed (i.e. 20 keyword targets, upload logo, make sure your campaign doesn't have an end date, etc.). Hypothesis was education mechanisms needed to be improved.

She launched a series of personalized emails based on specific defects. This would then bring them right to where they needed to be in the ad console to fix the issue. Once there they also provided in-product info on how to do what they needed to fix and why, more educational resources, etc.

Once she launched this program in Email and UI, in the 1st Q they saw attrition reduce 30% QoQ.  This then informed their acquisition strategy to not overwhelm new users. 

- **When it comes to measuring the effectiveness of email campaigns, what key performance indicators (KPIs) do you consider most important, and why?** How do you interpret and act on the data from these metrics to optimize future campaigns?

It's going to depend on the lifecycle. At seekout, what *is* the goal for email marketing?

If it's education, then the KPI is about CTO rate - of the people opening, how many are going to the resource? 

If it's conversion, she'd be looking at attrbitution data to tie back the campaign to opportunities (pipeline).


- **In terms of marketing automation, can you share an example of how you've leveraged it to personalize and target email communications for different audience segments?** What kind of personalization strategies have you found most effective?



- **When faced with multiple marketing initiatives and limited resources, how do you prioritize which projects to focus on?** Can you describe your approach to balancing short-term and long-term goals?




*** 

- **Describe a time when someone on your team challenged you to think differently about a problem.** What was the situation? How did you respond? What was the outcome?


- **Tell me about a time when you realized you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well.** What did you do about it? What was the outcome? Is there anything you'd have done differently?
