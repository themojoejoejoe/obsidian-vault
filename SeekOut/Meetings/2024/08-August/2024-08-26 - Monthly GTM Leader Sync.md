## Active Priorities
1. **Maturity Assessment**Â â€“ AsÂ @Lindsay SimonsÂ mentioned during the last AHM, this maturity assessment is our big bet on how we can drive top of funnel (TOFU) interest in Grow, and subsequently, pipeline. Ops is helping to support backend requirements leveraging the Marketo API, but in the meantime you can preview part of the experienceÂ [here](https://seekout-website-git-maturitymodel-seekout-marketing.vercel.app/maturity-model/assessment-hr-strengths "https://seekout-website-git-maturitymodel-seekout-marketing.vercel.app/maturity-model/assessment-hr-strengths")Â (WIP) and learn more about what weâ€™re doing on the backendÂ Â [![â€‹docx icon](cid:1809033971*image002.png@01DAF3B4.87F9AA40)Â here](https://zipstorm.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/MarketingTeamSite/EWmu4atlOWJPvu2sSTw3HFUB9X_1WnUde_ZcWnJolg2gQw?e=SWnU1d "https://zipstorm.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/MarketingTeamSite/EWmu4atlOWJPvu2sSTw3HFUB9X_1WnUde_ZcWnJolg2gQw?e=SWnU1d").
2. **Golf Scores 2.0**Â â€“ Weâ€™re developing a modified approach to how we assess productivity for sales & CS. Similar to Golf Scores v1, the intent of this mechanism is to understand our input actions and help everyone achieve and exceed their plan.
3. **Service Usage**Â â€“ Weâ€™re working with the product/engineering team & CS on framing out our requirements for data pipeline (read: getting usage data into the right systems for analysis/action) and reporting views needed to facilitate an internal MBR and external QBRs that require less manual effort/more automation. You can view the project board in AsanaÂ [here](https://app.asana.com/0/1207936686648752/1207946760840313 "https://app.asana.com/0/1207936686648752/1207946760840313").
4. **Asana Rollout for GTM Org**Â â€“ the next big thing coming from this initiative to drive Operational Excellence throughout the GTM org is rolling out Asana for all GTM teams. Everyone has a license today, so this rollout will focus on enablement, assistance with board/intake setup, and other best practices related to how we work and work together. More to come soon.
