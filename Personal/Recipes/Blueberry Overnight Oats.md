### Ingredients

- 2 cups old fashioned rolled oats
- 2 tablespoons chia seeds
- 2½ cups unsweetened almond milk
- 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 1 cup fresh blueberries

### Instructions

- Place the oats, chia seeds, almond milk and maple syrup in a large bowl. Stir together until combined. Cover with plastic wrap and store in the fridge overnight.

### Notes

- **Pro tip**: The chia seeds are essential to this recipe as they bloom in the liquid, creating a thick, creamy consistency. If you don't have any on hand, however, decrease the amount of milk to 2 cups total.
- Once thickened, portion your overnight oats into jars or containers for the perfect meal prep breakfast!  They keep in air tight containers in the fridge for up to 5 days.
- These oats are just perfect with a sky-high pile of blueberries, but feel free to add sliced almonds, nut butter, coconut flakes or any other add-ins that you deem appropriate.
