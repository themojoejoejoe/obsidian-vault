- What is the starting point for Customer Data related to usage?
	- Need to have a binary metric like "this account got value from SeekOut"
- Chris: What have you heard? What would be your ideal?
	- "Storytelling"
	- Recruit is actually a set of things you do across recruiting pipline
		- finding people
		- outreaching to people
		- ATS rediscovery (find and convert warm folks)
	- What are the 1-2 things we care about across the channel to report on the above? *How do we tell the story?*
	- GEM is all about finding candidates faster - don't know what the metric they use is, but that's their value prop

## Finding People
- Primary metric is exporting contacts
## Outreaching to People
* Metric based on responses
* Tailor content to create best outreach messages, optimized for success
## Rediscovery
- Number of profiles you're exporting (ATS Searches?)
## Applicant Review
* "Speed" - how much time do we save reviewing applicants?
* Active users who have used Applicant review in past month - engagement shows value
* Need to pull Applicant Review into service usage object

## Candidate Insights
