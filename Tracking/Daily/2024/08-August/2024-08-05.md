# Weekly GTM Sync

Joe
- [WIN] Universal Landing Page Template migration completed Friday
- **Account Health Scoring** – sync scheduled with Hillel & Cass for tomorrow. To review where users and accounts fall in the proposed MVP model, discuss any necessary changes, and align on build.
- **Maturity Assessment** – the Corp marketing team is leading an effort to bring a "maturity assessment" to our website that enables prospects and customers to understand how they compare to their peers. Ops is developing the technical mechanisms to pass assessment data from the website into our systems for various automations (initially serving the right content back, but could be used as targeting parameters in future campaigns as well as creating another inbound mechanism)
