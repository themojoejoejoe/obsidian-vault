I would like to express my gratitude for Ben Rotholtz. Today is his last day at SeekOut and he has made amazing contributions over the last year and a half, like saving the business hundreds of thousands of dollars totally rearchitecting our website stack and quite literally doing the work of *several* people just out of his sheer expertise and expansive mental bandwidth. It's a truly bittersweet moment for our team, but more than anything I'm proud of Ben and the growth he's had at SeekOut that have led him to his new opportunity. 

Ben, we wish you the best of luck and I look forward to the day our professional paths cross again. In the meantime you can't get rid of me, so sorry not sorry.
