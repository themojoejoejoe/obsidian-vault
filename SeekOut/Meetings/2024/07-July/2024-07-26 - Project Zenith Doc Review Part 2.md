	- Need to have a monthly deep dive
	- *Decision: we'll do both*
	- Who is building the agenda to get the most important things we need to discuss in this meeting?
		-  hit 3 core topics once a month
		- Use 4 blockers to gather topics and make due a few days in advance of monthly meeting. From here, surface main topics for each monthly meeting's agenda
	- Monday to establish what we're goign to do/how we're going to do this moving forward
- MBRs/QBRs
	- Start separately and eventually combine
