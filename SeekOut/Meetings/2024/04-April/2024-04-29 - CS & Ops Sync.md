- ChurnZero is not panning out.
	- Reason: CSM can't look at book of business and send out information to customers on their own book. "Can't do stuff at the end user level"
	- Looking at Vitally
		- Easy to use, not robust
	- Totango
		- under $50K, more robust
	- Cass is scoping out
	- Timeline for report out: TBD
- SDFC Chat platform - potentially use for Support?
	- Nothing wrong with Intercom, just looking for ways to save money
