- Bi-Annual Operational Planning Discipline
	- Laura
		- what timeframe is reasonable?
		- Be okay with qualitative 
		- To start first planning cycle in Q4, but for now focus on goals and alignment
	- Bryce
		- We have a quarterly target breakdown now throughout the year
		- This is better than what we have today, so let's do it
		- Revenue Town Hall on Aug 14th
		- Need to figure out timing
- Accountability
	- Bryce
		- A lot of the inputs are outputs (like pipeline)
		- We need to take another look at the inputs to ensure people are doing the inputs to get the desired outputs (or at least trying)
			- Attempts at prospecting
			- QBRs
			- etc.
		- Potentially a point system? Bryce would like help with expectations we set and another iteration of the golf score to measure inputs
- Green light on Cross-functional interviewing & 360 process
- Revamp how we want to do golf score v2
