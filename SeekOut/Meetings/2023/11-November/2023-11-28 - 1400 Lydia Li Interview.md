- **Tell me about a time when you didn't know what to do next or how to solve a challenging problem.** How do you learn what you don't know? What were the options you considered? How did you decide the best parth forward? What was the outcome.

At Vida Health, Lydia worked on the email channel to attract new prospects into the pipeline for opp creation. They had a challenge where lead to MQL was very slow - when Lydia first joined, she considered the challenge complex and needed to break it down to more simplified components to be solved 1 by 1. 

To do this, she started by reviewing current benchmarks and conversions. They were already tracking by different channels how that velocity differed. She identified email as an area of opportunity and "low hanging fruit". She developed a hypothesis that targeting wasn't focused enough and MQL definition was murky across teams. She also hypothesized that the content may not have been relevant. She deprioritized this to focus first on targeting (make it relevant vs changing the targeting). 

They separate MQLs by job titles: chief financial officer (care about cost savings) and House Benefits manager (care about employee engagement and outcomes). She then developed the messaging for these 2 groups and personally wrote, built and deployed emails via HubSpot. She incorporated subject line and CTA testing.

Results: saw increases to click through rate. She then applied this learning to additional titles and found that some had better improvement but some didn't. 

Just trying to figure out the specific root cause, she simplfied 

* **Tell me about the most exciting automated lifecycle nurture you've worked on.** What made it exciting? What was the goal? What was the result?

Nurture email campaign to increase lead to MQL conversion and MQL to SQL conversion. Goes to house plans segment and is more complex than employer in understanding their pain points. The exciting part was defining the messaging and working with the content teams to translate go to market campaign into an email wmade it the most exciting.

Goal: improve engagement rate.

First she worked on understanding the buyer persona better, second developed messaging and spoke with clients about why they chose Vida, third worked with content team to use the messaging they generated to leverage across emails.

She then used that content to build automated email campaigns for each identified persona. She is excited to test out (I missed the term but  industry buzzword) because it will help them determine what content is most relevant for a given person.

A/B Tested subject line and email content. Used HubSpot and had 2 versions of a given email. Tested one thing at a time (open rate vs CTR). Set up testing to measure within 24-48 hours. Uses an online tool to determine statistical significance

Email series was 5-6 emails

- **When it comes to measuring the effectiveness of email campaigns, what key performance indicators (KPIs) do you consider most important, and why?** How do you interpret and act on the data from these metrics to optimize future campaigns?

"Depends on audience." Her current marketing team doesn't care so much about open/click but care more about "trend." PM teams want to know MQL counts, Opps, etc. Sales team cares more about job titles and who is engaging. 

Lydia maintains her own scorecard tracking to identify areas for improvement/optimization. She monitors delivery rate, unsub, open rate, CTR.

Testing between the terms "mental health" and "guaranteed outcomes." She noticed high open/click rates among emails whose subject lines mentioned mental health. 


- **In terms of marketing automation, can you share an example of how you've leveraged it to personalize and target email communications for different audience segments?** What kind of personalization strategies have you found most effective?


- **When faced with multiple marketing initiatives and limited resources, how do you prioritize which projects to focus on?** Can you describe your approach to balancing short-term and long-term goals?

*** 

- **Describe a time when someone on your team challenged you to think differently about a problem.** What was the situation? How did you respond? What was the outcome?



- **Tell me about a time when you realized you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well.** What did you do about it? What was the outcome? Is there anything you'd have done differently?



@joe
 these are great examples for your "curious" focus, i especially like the 2nd one. if you want to include one of those with a few specific questions to assess their functional expertise that would be perfect.
the functional areas Laura and I mapped for you are:
- Email one-off and program execution, automation, measurement
- Automation platform usage
- Prioritization, use of data to inform initiatives and roadmap
