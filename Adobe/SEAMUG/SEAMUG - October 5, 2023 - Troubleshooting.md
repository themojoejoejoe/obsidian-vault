## Session Abstract
**Working Title:** Troubleshooting Tips and Networking: Elevating Your Marketo Game

**Description:** 

Join us for our next meeting on Thursday, October 5th, from 4-5:30pm at Adobe's Seattle HQ. This session's topic is troubleshooting tips and tricks, and we are thrilled to have an opportunity to share and learn from other Marketo users.  
  
Are you struggling with a specific issue or challenge in your Marketo campaigns? Do you have a solution that has worked well for you that you'd like to share with the group? This is the perfect opportunity to collaborate, connect, and ask questions.  
  
This is a great way to learn a bit more about Marketo Engage and connect with other users in the Seattle area.  
  
As always, there will be plenty of time for networking and socializing. Beverages will be provided and we’ll be raffling off some Amazon gift cards. We look forward to seeing you there!
