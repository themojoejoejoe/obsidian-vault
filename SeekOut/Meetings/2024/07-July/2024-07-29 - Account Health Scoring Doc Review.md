- diversity searching, power filters, and security clearance - cass' concern is if we lose visibility on these things as the "most valuable" things they can do with SeekOut, account health becomes less informative/useful
	- Solve is to expand HVA types (so these types of searches count as an HVA type and overall events are tracked more accurately without inflation)
- Need to have record-level health score in addition to account health score that's aggregated

- [ ] Size accounts by current health scoring proposal
