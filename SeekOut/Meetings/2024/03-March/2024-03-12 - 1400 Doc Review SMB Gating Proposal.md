- Ed - 2 or 3 requirements missing
	- What happens if ZoomInfo can't provide an employee count
	- Non-Sourcecon version only shows price to people that pass the validation check
		- Laura: we could potentially use the /pricing/smb page and use scenario 1
- Generally agree that the on-site experience is the ideal
	- Julia: we can match to Admin Cosmo DB
- Laura: ideally need an event that Google and other ad platforms can see for optimization (i.e. see a success point)
	- javascript tracking pixel in the product that fires the event
- Ed - need the ability to know who gets rejected
- Pre-populate an allow list and have the API check Marketo?
	- if you fail, you get a message that sales or someone will reach out
- Need to have a way of surfacing the reject reason
- Julia:
	- If they are from a company too big: get message 1
	- If they are not on allow list: contact sales
- Julia to ask Prijoe to use SeekOut to identify companies/domains less than 100 employees
- If company is too big, customer with open opportunity, and existing customer - each of these needs a custom error message

## SourceCon Page
- Shows price on page with Buy Now CTA
- 

## Long-term Page
* On purchase, engineering to fire event to GTM via javascript tracking pixel
