I've never been able to fully decide if this is a generational thing or simply unique to the corporate world, but often times people don't really say what they mean. I know: *thou art shooketh.* 

Obviously as humans, we all do this to a degree to present the best versions of ourselves to the world. Invariably at some point in your career (probably day-fucking-one) you'll hear leaders and colleagues alike spinning results or cherry-picking facts & figures to support a message that sounds good but doesn't have a lot of substance. Common metaphors about the nutritional value of popcorn or American Chinese food  apply here.

If you make genuine candor table stakes in all of your dealings, I promise you, you will be held in nearly universally high esteem by just about everyone. Candor by itself simply means "the quality of being open and honest in expression." So what's the indefatigable part?

Apart from being perhaps *the* most badass thing you could name a ship (I mean seriously, the nicknames jump off the page: The Indy, The Fatso, De Fat Ass [for the large vessels], The Stable Gable... Honestly why every boat isn't named this is beyond me), indefatigable means "tirelessly persistent." The math majors reading this have already put my meaning together: **the advice here is to be tirelessly persistent in how transparent you are at work.**

It's often not the most expedient thing to be, granted.
