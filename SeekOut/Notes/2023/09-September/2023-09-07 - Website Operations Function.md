summary: Requirements for backfilling Ben and creating a web ops function with fewer single points of dependency.
---
---

## Current Situation
Ben Rotholtz architected our website technology stack and did the work of both a web ops manager and a frontend developer. He has decided to pursue an opportunity outside of SeekOut, and we now have an opportunity and imperative to remove a single point of dependency to establish a more scaleable website operations function.

Since Ben's unique combination of expertise spans several roles, there are two high-level options:

1. We attempt to backfill Ben's role with someone with similar expertise.
2. We split Ben's current role into several more focused roles.
