## MBR Recap
- Anoop: simple thing that can be done, like getting 1P data offered by customers/prospects. Would require some brainstorming
- Steph: "We are not at the appropriate size to have multiple attribution models"

## Sales Development
- Monitor commercial MQL SLAs and MQL>SAL>SQL>CW as does not go through SDR
- Anoop question about how long outbounding takes. We should monitor TAL age
- Anoop/Bryce: *Would more SDRs result in more pipline? At what point do we reach diminishing returns in terms of SDR population re: impact?*
- Possible follow-up around Dedicated IP for email
- No decision on SAL auto-remarket

## Anatomy of the Deal
- Anoop: look at top 20 opps won this year to identify commonalities/trends
	- can we identify any behavior that helps us effect meaningful change?

## Targets
- Anoop: "don't talk to me about aggregated pipeline" (wants to understand breakouts by account segment, deal size, etc.)
