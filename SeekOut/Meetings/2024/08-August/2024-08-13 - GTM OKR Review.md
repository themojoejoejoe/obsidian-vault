- Right now we do once a quarter OKR review; Bryce wants to do a more frequent touchbase on OKRs (maybe in Monthly GTM)
	- Eventually include in all MBRs
- Golf Scores 2.0
	- Opportunity - 1 point
	- Meeting - 1 point
	- Professional development - 1 point
	- Need to understand how to track everything
	- Need to be careful how we present so it doesn't come across as micromanagement
- Team-level OKRs - need to have a growth/development goal for team members
-
