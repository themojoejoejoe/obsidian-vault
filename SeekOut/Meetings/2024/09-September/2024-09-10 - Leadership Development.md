### Storytelling [End to End]

#### What are the barriers and can we overcome them?
- We lack a single cohesive SeekOut story - fragments quickly across TA & TM
- Not a large barrier, just time to develop and communicate
	- Doc about here's who we are, here's how we do it
- Do we have the right reporting to support the story?
- Pre-sales: time & attention
- Product issues
- How to craft story that doesn't lose focus (i.e. talking about every feature, like Pipeline Insights)

#### What would we need? (resources, other dependencies)
- A story of *why we exist in the world* and how we serve various talent profiles
	- Must be succinct and impactful
- Deliver on the story [proof]

#### How will this help?
- Reduces churn via aligning perceived value and received value
- Reduce friction in the sales process (deal velocity)
- Improves sales talk-track consistency
- 

### Specific Mission/Rally Cry

### ICP Clarity
#### What are the barriers and can we overcome them?
- Operationalized/Mechanized definition
- Being willing/able to say no

- Past ICP customers that had a poor experience with SeekOut - how to win back?

#### What would we need? (resources, other dependencies)

- improve win rate

-

#### What are the barriers and can we overcome them?
