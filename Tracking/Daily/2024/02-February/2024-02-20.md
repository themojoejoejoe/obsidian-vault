# Ops Lead
1. What efficiencies do we gain with this structure?
2. What capacity and resources are there to improve? 
4. What would reporting structure look like with a combined Operations team?
5. What can you provide to the team? *or* How would/could we reassign outstanding IC work?
	1. Platform Operations - GenGen still only has ~3.5 months experience as a Marketo admin, so not quite ready to own day-to-day administration and ongoing management
	2. Campaign Operations would have a single point of dependency on 1 FTE. Dual custody QA no longer possible *unless* we decentralize marketing execution again.
	3. Website technical management (near/short term)
	4. Webinar A/V production (2-4 times annually, but ideally want to visit reassigning ownership with Design team - Tallon)

### Notes
- Amp it up is about focus
	- "our focus was growth" - anything else, get out of my office
	- Bryce in favor of diplomatic challenging for the best result
- needs someone to think through the resources and jobs to be done, how do we optimize and how do we scale?
	- No optimization of what product is doing, how do we ringfence our resources
