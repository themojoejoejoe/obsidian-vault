> [!note] Agenda + Notes
> 1. Swimlanes (i.e. when do we create a new page on the website vs when does marketing self-serve creating a Marketo Landing Page?)
> 2. Process â€“ how the team can request support
> 3. Rules of Engagement/SLAs
> 4. TBD

- Scope of Work
	- Creating components (biggest potential ask, i.e. for the demo page)
	- New pages
	- Page Updates
- Time commitment estimate: not full time engineer
- I mentioned if we didn't backfill Ben by Q4 we'd need to look into agency support
- VR: use designer in India as a cost-effective medium term owner. 
	- need to educate/train them on our current website stack
- VR: if we hire a senior front end engineer, I think they would be reasonable and that would work.
