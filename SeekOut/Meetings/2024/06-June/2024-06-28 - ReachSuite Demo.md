- 2 primary challenges (provided by Chris):
	- High volume SMB deals are killing us and pulling the AEs away from strategic, higher value deals AND customer expansion
	- CS needs help w onboarding and faster expansion playbooks when people donâ€™t want to meet
- ReachSuite is an interactive demo platform with a bend towards personalization capabilities (to maximize conversions)
- Comparison to Storylane
	- ![[Pasted image 20240628084129.png]]
	- Key differentiator is auto-updating. 
	- Also works differently/better than Storylane for tracking
		- Storylane: creates a page/URL that we place into an iframe. *Pain:* we lack tracking capabilities because of this.
		- Didn't get a *detailed* response, but assurance that Storylane doesn't suffer from the same affliction. **We'd need to press on this in future reviews.**
	- Form Options
		- can embed a reachsuite form and use an integration to push to Marketo/SFDC
		- Can point to a different landing page experience at the end of the demo (avoids integration challenges)
