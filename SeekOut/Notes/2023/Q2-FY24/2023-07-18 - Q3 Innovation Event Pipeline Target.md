Audience targeting for this event is still being finalized. [Asana ticket with details here](https://app.asana.com/0/1205011052094373/1205070069498063/f). 

After we define the audience, we will need to work backwards to estimate how many people will register and attend. This will in turn help us understand how many opportunities we might expect coming out of this event, and an average opportunity amount. All together, this will enable us to recommend a realistic pipeline target.

We have conducted an analysis based on the three flagship hosted webinars conducted this fiscal year, and observed the following trends:

1. ***Registration rate among customers is significantly higher than registration rate among prospects.*** The average registration rate among customers was over 2x higher (487 BPS) than that of prospects.
2. ***We can expect an average registration rate of approximately 8.5% among customers and 3.6% among prospects.*** These estimates exclude the What's New webinar, as that event was more granularly targeted and the data associated creates an outlier.
3. ***We can expect an average of 0.12 New Business opportunities per Prospect attendee and 0.03 Expansion Opportunities per Customer Attendee***. For example, if we have 1000 prospect attendees and 1000 customer attendees, we could reasonably expect 120 New Business opportunities and 30 Expansion Opportunities
4. ***Our YTD Average New Business Opportunity value is $26.5K, while YTD Average Expansion Opportunity value is $34.0K.*** Based on this limited dataset, the, the pipeline projections are quite low ($7.8K for New Business and 3.0K for Expansion opportunities). This is because many of the expansion opportunities opened after this year's event are still in the SAL stage and do not have a pipeline amount specified yet. Therefore, Marketing Operations recommends using our actual YTD averages, in combination with the opportunities per attendee numbers above.

Based on the initial audience targeting assessment, if we invite 25.7K customers and 844 prospects, we can expect approximately 1.9K registrants (30 Prospects, 1,927 Customers). Using our attendance benchmark of 30.0%, we could then expect approximately 587 attendees (9 Prospects, 578 Customers). Finally, leveraging historical data, we forecast generating $7.2K New Business Pipeline and $589.8K Expansion pipeline from this event.

## Risks & Dependencies
In Q1, we realized that opportunities were being advanced too quickly to the next stage (SQL), resulting in lost deals. We learned that proper qualification of these opportunities is crucial to avoid inflating the pipeline and causing pipeline volatility. In Q2, we noticed that opportunities have been getting stuck in the initial stage (SAL) for longer periods. Since pipeline estimates are not required at this stage, our quarter-to-date (QtD) pipeline was significantly lower compared to previous quarters. These factors present challenges in accurately forecasting the pipeline for this particular event, especially considering the limited dataset of recent similar campaigns.
