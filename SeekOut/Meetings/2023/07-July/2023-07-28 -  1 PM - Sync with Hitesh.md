- High level conversation about a realistic scenario for Q3 pipeline targets (based on Q4 revenue targets)
- Laura: MOPs to model on conversion mulitiplier from when we entered Q2 vs how much ARR was closed in Q2
	- We entered Q1 with X Pipeline, how much incremental pipe was added in Q1, Y% was created in Q2, etc... 
- If we reduce paid spend, we reduce pipeline contribution from marketing by ~33% (Laura said this as a high level estimate when Hitesh asked "what could we expect if we reduced costs")
