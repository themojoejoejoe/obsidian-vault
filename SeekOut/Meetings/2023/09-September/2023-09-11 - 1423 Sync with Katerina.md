> Sync with Katerina on upcoming CS projects 

Use 2 systems in Support with divided ownership with Marketing:
- Contentful
- Intercom

She'd occassionally get help from Ben on technical setup. The main project upcoming is InfoSec:
- Signed contract with company that want data handled only by US citizens
- If ticket comes from particular customer, it needs to be sent only to US citizens.

Used to use Zendesk but now use Contentful. Need support on revamping the help center. K used the word "redo"
