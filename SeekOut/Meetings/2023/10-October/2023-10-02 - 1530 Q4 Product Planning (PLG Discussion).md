- Defining Metrics:
	- Claire
		- *Demand Generation* - conversion rate from web traffic
		* *User Activation & Education* - Conversion of how we convert licenced user to "Monthly Engaged User"
			- Someone that logs into SeekOut more than 4x/month
		- *Renewal* - how to measure 
- What could be helpful to move a prospect to someone wanting to buy:
- (John) Do we create a self-service experience or a more curated experience?
	- curated experiences - what are the "buckets" of bespoke experiences we need?
- What's the value of a demo?
	- differentiating features, cleared candidates, 
- Online Purchasing
	- What is an appropriate dollar amount for getting people to use a CC on the website?
- What's the simplest experience we could show to a prospect to make them take the next step?
	- more guided self-serve demo
		- customers don't know what filters are available
- Renewal/Expansion
	- make it easy to highlight features without a CSM being hands-on
- Resistance to in-app guides
	- In previous iteration, team did not feel it was effective in getting people to interact with experience
- Monthly/Quarterly Usage report sent to decision makers
- Onboarding task checklist
-
