## Summary of Key Accomplishments
1. **Customer Lifecycle Model**
	1. In Q3 FY24, SeekOut only had a prospect lifecycle model - meaning we did not have the capability to report on attribution for renewal or expansion opportunities among customers. This was due to a technology limitation with Bizible that required an upgrade. In his first month on the job, GenGen singlehandedly drafted requirements for expanding the model, as well as detailed definitions for each stage and the transition rules between them. He then executed building the model in Marketo with the Director of Operations providing QA support. This project represents one of the most complex marketing automation programs possible and requires not only a high degree of platform expertise, but also the ability to align with intelligence operations, sales leadership and the revops team regarding how the model functions, reporting requirements, key handoffs, and how it supports or eliminates previous processes. There are well over 100 assets that GenGen needed to configure in Marketo to make this model work, and to do so in his first month in his role demonstrates the herculean effort and focus that GenGen brings to every task.
2. **5 Custom Segmentations for dynamic content + targeting**
	1. GenGen identified a need to make email and landing page content dynamic by certain segments, and also to provide marketing stakeholders with easier-to-understand targeting parameters. As such, he created detailed segments to identify customers vs prospects, MQL owners, Persona, Industry, and Ideal Customer Profile.
3. **Abandon Cart**
	1. GenGen proposed and executed a plan to capture visitors to our pricing page that do not convert and send them an email inviting them to take a virtual demo and ultimately book a meeting with sales.
4. **100EE Automation**
	1. Sales leadership brought a capacity challenge to our attention: with the majority of our MQLs being in the SMB account segment (61% in August), sellers were spending an inordinate amount of time fielding these opportunities, which often are lost due to people requesting a demo primarily to see the product and get a sense of pricing (read: "tire kickers"). GenGen drafted requirements and executed on a program that intercepts demo requests from people at companies with fewer than 100 employees. Instead of routing them to sales for qualification/follow-up, GenGen sends them an email invitation to experience a virtual demo via storylane.io, which at the end presents the user with ballpark pricing per license and gives them an option to book a meeting with sales directly. In this way, we ensure sales bandwidth is only applied to the most serious buyers.
5. **Bizible Optimization (ongoing)**
6. **Key Facilitator for all campaign ops**
