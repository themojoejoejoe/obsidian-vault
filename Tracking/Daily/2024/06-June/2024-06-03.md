I had a great run this morning! I'm still slow and I've never been a strong distance runner... but running almost 2 miles without stopping is huge for me at this point in my life. Makes me want to stick with it and improve.

It's probably helped by the fact that I'm ~8 days into this tolerance break. Maybe I can use this one to redefine my relationship with marijuana - I like the idea of being an only occassional smoker/edible consumer, both for the potency and the long-term health effects.
