- Hillel: Hoping to have CSMs
	- do opening/discovery
	- First thing from Seekout standpoint is showing activity data
- Mike: 
	- Team wants to be able to include OR exclude competitor/peer data
- Monthly Total Searches is a measure of effort, not efficiency or throughput
- **Build views like slides, export straight to powerpoint**
- Stacked chart on slide 18 doesn't present well and data gets lost. Mike would like to break out as an option (so one slide for each type of search)
- **Is it possible to set parameters on one screen and it flows through all the views so CSMs can export slides once?**
- Slide 19 â€“ color coded between usage metrics & actioned profiles
	- highlighting inactivity has not gone well, so organize by names alphabetically
-
