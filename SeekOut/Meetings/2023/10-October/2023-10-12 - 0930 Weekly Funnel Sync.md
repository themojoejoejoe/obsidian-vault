- Average Deal Size is trending down, but we do not know if win rate is going up
	- Chris "reasons it may stay lower"
		- Compete campaigns are well received/positive, but when we get people on the phone budget comes up sooner because that's the reason they're taking the call
		- We think we'll see higher volume and higher win rates, but deal rates will be smaller

Win Rate does seem to be trending up slowly
