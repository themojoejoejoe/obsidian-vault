> [!note] Agenda + Notes
> - Can we figure out how to get more visibility in what marketing is sending to clients
> - Can we move communication logging to the contact in SF so we don't have to go to Marketo tab to see whats being sent?
> - Can CS and marketing tlak so we can make sure we're not over-spamming clients


**Summary:**

Visibility into customer actions – including what emails they’ve engaged with and other interesting moments, like event registrations, demo requests, etc. – are all available from the contact view in SFDC under “Marketo Sales Insights” (see screenshots below). However, because 600+ tech target contacts are managed by a single FTE, this 1:1 inspection is not practical in those cases.

Given the sync limits between Marketo & SFDC, we also cannot simply sync every individual we email to bespoke SFDC campaigns because this would inhibit other time sensitive operations (i.e. MQL routing). 

We also discussed how Marketo access for CS wasn’t a viable solve because of the system’s learning curve and non-linear nature. There isn’t a simple queue of upcoming emails to review, and which evergreen nurtures an individual may qualify for is also constantly shifting.

> [!todo] Action Items


- [x] Action: MOPs to investigate email integration capabilities with Slack (i.e. Marketo email sends appear in a slack channel in real-time) ✅ 2023-08-29

	- Alternatively, we can include a CS alias on all sends. FWIW we’ve offered around this time last year and no one signed up for the interest list.

- [ ] Action: Joe to coordinate broader email channel “State of the Union” review between Marketing, CS, and RevOps/Sales Development. 

	- Purpose: provide a deeper understanding of what emails are sent from which systems, how we manage reporting, and how governance/accountability works across the entire email channel.
