- Mixpanel learnings: 
	- customers get lost/confused with fully interactive demos
	- As product changes, no code solutions like Navattic need to be recreated each time
- Can be customized by Persona
- gated experience: 70-80% drop out rate
	- recommendation: don't gate the demo experience on the front, but maybe at the middle or end
- Can embed marketo form
- Capture method takes screenshots that you can edit to change content, blur it out, delete, etc., then string those screenshots together into a cohesive experience
- Offers a free demo build if we are willing to give them access to SeekOut
