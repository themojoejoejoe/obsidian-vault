# LinkedIn Announcement

I've accepted a new role at Vercel and I could *NOT* be more excited to tackle some of the scale challenges that come with such a successful startup. I love serving developers and we're going to get up to some really special work with the best tech!

Reflecting on my time at SeekOut, joining a Series B (now Series C) B2B SaaS startup has been a crash course in growth and alignment. One of the biggest challenges in a high-growth environment is ensuring alignment across all teams so that everyone is moving in the same direction toward shared goals. Focus is key—trying to be everything to everyone usually means missing what matters for your core ICP and stalls growth.

I came in with the opportunity to build a marketing ops function from the ground up. That sounds great, but like any scaling startup, we inherited some legacy systems and processes that weren’t always set up with a long-term vision in mind. Even with those hurdles, my team and I pushed through and delivered. We rolled out Marketo, set up Bizible for attribution, and built Tableau dashboards for visibility. We introduced a full customer lifecycle model, from prospect to closed won, and drove a 15.4% MQL Acceptance Rate. We also took on a complete website rebrand and rebuilt it using React and Next.js, which taught me a thing or two about CR/CD and some early coding skills.

These high notes (and so many more high, low, and blue notes) wouldn't have been possible without the following people: GenGen Quintana Morales, Lauren Sullivan, Howard Becker, Ginelle Peterson, and Lance Thompson. You’re all badasses who continually drive real improvement with urgency and grace, and it’s been a privilege working with you. I am immensely proud of the Ops ship we've run at SeekOut and I'm leaving with the knowledge that it's still in the best hands. 

I’m leaving SeekOut with a deep appreciation for the lessons learned, the incredible people I’ve worked with, and the strong foundation we’ve built. I’m excited to bring these experiences to Vercel and continue growing. LFG!

# Transition Doc
## Overview of Current Initiatives and Priorities

### Ongoing Projects

All active Operations work is tracked via[ the Ops Center Asana board](https://app.asana.com/0/1207174369569656/1207174308300544). These tasks represent both big rock priorities, ad hoc stakeholder requests, and team-identified needs (read: tickets we create ourselves). The Ops team conducts a weekly grooming exercise to determine whether a given task is "in progress" (planned to be worked on that week), blocked or awaiting dependencies, under review, or backlogged.

That said, the following is a brief summary of the Operations team's main priorities:

1. Project Zenith – This effort is intended to introduce greater operational excellence and rigor across the entire GTM organization, and there are two main outstanding tasks: 1/ rolling out Asana to the CS org, and 2/ instituting an biannual planning process starting in Q4.
2. Operations Roadmapping – Ginelle has kicked off roadmap planning for RevOps, but more broadly I was planning to use Operations as the example of how to come up with a roadmap doc like [this](https://zipstorm.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/MarketingTeamSite/EdEmu3fne8dDmEEixYtxEmYBOkxRJqZgXQlsNDqFhGq-wQ?e=RUtMej) for the GTM org 1st Operational Planning cycle.
3. Maturity Assessment – The organic experience is launched and we are currently finalizing the Paid Social flow and testing how effective we can be with syncing partial assessment data from abandoners.
4. 

### Key Metrics & Goals

While the Operations org doesn't own any one *single* metric, our work spans all functions and therefore we maintain vigilance over a number of different metrics:

1. MQL Acceptance Rate – Sometimes referred to more directly as "MQL-to-SQL CVR," this is a measurement of the rate in which leads marketing sends to sales as "ready to buy" are associated with new opportunities. YTD, this rate is ~15.4% and is currently an all-time high.

  

## Team and Stakeholder Information

### Team Structure
The Operations organization is comprised of 4 primary components:

1. Marketing Operations (GenGen Quintana Morales)
2. Web Operations (Lauren Sullivan & Tirlochan Arora)
3. Intelligence Operations (Howard Becker)
4. Revenue Operations (Lance Thompson, Ginelle Peterson)

*Recommendation:* Depending on how my role is backfilled, it likely makes sense to restructure web operations as a standalone function within the broader marketing organization, reporting to VP of Growth marketing. Reason being it'll be challenging to find an Operations leader with significant experience across MOPs, RevOps, Analytics, *and* web ops.

### Stakeholder Relationships

## Known Issues and Risk Management

### Current Risks
- Campaign Operations/Bar Raising – SeekOut leverages a dual custody review process for outbound marketing motions, meaning one person configures the experience and another reviews and activates. This level of QA helps mitigate the risk of human errors and is the main reason we haven't had a major customer-facing error at SeekOut in the past 3 years. Until/Unless another resource is identified (i.e. a backfill or agency support) or another marketing team member , the Operations team lacks a 2nd person with Marketing Automation expertise and 
- Video Editing/Production – SeekOut owns a webinar production kit for higher quality video projects, but lacks editing software and a user with sufficient experience to use it. I've used a personal copy of Final Cut Pro for basic edits (cuts, extend screenshot timing, adding bumpers and audio, etc.), but minimally SeekOut will need to purchase some sort of editing suite and identify an owner. As far as leveraging the webinar kit,[ we have prepared this step-by-step guide.](https://zipstorm.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/MarketingTeamSite/EQ3MtM9ajfVAof4RVzCCRNgBuit0xUWolOCnS9_1eOIXXA?e=9Ok1ol)
