After 6 weeks of no smoking, I picked up a little flower on Friday. Predictably, I hit it a little hard... I ground 1 of the 3 buds that came in the eighth and smoked that over the course of the weekend - 2 sessions Friday, 3 or 4 on Saturday, then 2 on Sunday. That's too much and I knew it then as much as I do now.

Self-control is a weird thing. I don't struggle for it once I commit, but in the day-to-day moments when I want a quick hit, it's barely a thought on my mind. I need to hold myself back better. 

Still no word from Muck Rack. The only update I received last week was a check-in email from Lisa (CMO) to see if I was still interested and had any questions. I said I was excited to chat with the CEO, knowing that's the next/final step of the process, but honestly I'm still hoping they decide that's a silly requirement and just extend an offer this week. They won't, of course - if they already burned last week trying to coordinate schedules, they're probably committed to that plan/policy this week still. 

Maybe my baseless optimism knows no bounds. /s
