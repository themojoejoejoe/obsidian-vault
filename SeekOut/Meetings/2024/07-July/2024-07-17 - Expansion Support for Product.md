Purpose: looking for ways to sell features to customers who don't have them

- Want to get click data for individual users. Could possibly associate to the user based on Mixpanel data
- Want to have a CTA button that results in MQLs on click and add to an SFDC campaign
- Abby to follow up with Chris H on process and timeline for storylane demoes
- 2,231 licenses without access to these features
-
