There are 3 primary options for event follow-up:
1. Fully manual
2. Fully automated
3. Semi-automated (automated with manual customizations)

## Fully Manual
In this approach, a leader or sales owner sends all follow-up communications manually via Outlook. 

*Pros*:
- Full control by the sender to customize each message

*Cons*:
- Relies on an individual's capacity
- The slowest/least efficient follow-up mechanism

## Fully Automated
In this approach, all follow-up emails are previously configured and automatically deploy at the conclusion of an event.

*Pros*:
- Most efficient follow-up mechanism: no one needs to complete any post-event actions
- Messages arrive at a customizable time (i.e. at event end, within X hours of event end, etc.)
- Sender can still CC a sales owner (requires MOPs enablement)

*Cons*:
- Message is not editable by individual sellers/leaders
- If sent on behalf of a SeekOtter, they will receive any automatic replies (i.e. OOO messages, delivery failures, etc.)
	- Also applies to anyone CC'd

## Semi-Automated
This is a blend of the previous two approaches, where everything is set as fully automated but not scheduled until after event attendees confirm whose messages they want to customize.

*Pros:*
- Creates a 100% optional path to customization

*Cons:*
- Requires sellers to perform an action within a specified timeframe (i.e. provide a list, update a record, etc.)
- Follow-up timeliness depends on individual capacity
