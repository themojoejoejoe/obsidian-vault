## CLT Sync Breakout Group
- *Breakout: John T, Jean, Hillel, Kristi*
- **How does Angela Lee Duckworth's concept of grit apply to how we operate day-to-day as individuals, leaders, and as a company?**
	- Jean: "Never quit on your worst day, quit on your best day" - Never rate your experience at the highs and lows, but consider experiences more holistically
	- Joe: How we align with transparency, when we hit obstacles and how we align. Not getting stuck, and holding ourselves and each other to the highest standard
	- John: "Sticking with your future" - one place we aren't doing a great job is we don't have a super clear future we're trying to get to so you can say "today sucked, but we know where we're going." We don't talk about goals, small and company-wide enough.
		- What prevents us from crystallizing that long-term vision/direction?
			- We haven't quite spent enough time figuring out how to adapt innovations to market changes
	- Kristi: The makeup of the workforce is changing rapidly in terms of what motivates and drives people. Past methodologies in HR don't really exist anymore. We have to be cautious about following the crowd. Have to be open minded and focused.
	- John Re:Grow – the only thing that has draw and importance is bid & proposal. Everything else is a nice to have.
- **In Brene Brown's video, what resonated most with you personally?** 
	- 
- **After reflecting on both of these videos, what changes will you  make as a  leader and how should we embody these lessons as CLT?**
	- Sticking with bets longer term (GRIT)
	- Operating with greater transparency, continuing to break down the siloes

## Equity at SeekOut
- Equity Repricing – have been looking at options since ~November 2023 and have now reached the point where we think it's the right time to move forward with repricing. 
- Not approved by board ye
- 409A valuations enable companies to issue options to employees at a specific value (Strike Price)
- The price we received is set by the 409A valuation - it's not a true valuation of the company, but it's an assessment for tax/IRS purposes. This is to prevent companies from preventing artificially low prices and tax evasion.
