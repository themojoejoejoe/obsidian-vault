# Tirlochan Feedback from Adam

- "Not going well"
	- basic repository cleanup not happening on his own (which Adam has been coaching him on and making recommendations)
		- *is this a bandwidth thing, how we've tasked him, or an expectation we also have?*
	- 1 PR has 28 comments on it, primarily repeated information that has been covered previously
	- In terms of new code, "there's a lot of basic stuff he's not doing well."
		- he'll sometimes partially apply the right idea - like in one place he'll do something correctly and elsewhere where he should take the same approach he'll "brute force it"
	- **The time commitment for Adam to supervise him is getting to be too much**
	- Adam suspects there may be some intentional working around him with Frank because he would "pick apart" PRs
