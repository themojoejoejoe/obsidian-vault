## Context from Bryce
- We have a perpetual pipeline coverage
	- market related, execution related, whatever
	- 1st step is to understand gap
		- where are we today?
		- where do we need to be?
		- what do we need to do to get there?
- Pipeline Coverage: Overall win rate, back it against current pipeline to understand "what are you going to close?"
	- i.e., for a 25% win rate, you need 4x coverage to hit the target that quarter
- How do we set the pipeline generation target?
	- how do we break it down by channel?
		- how does each channel get to that number?
- How do we work as a team to solve pipeline coverage?
