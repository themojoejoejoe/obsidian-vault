I'm officially 2 weeks in to a tolerance break from THC. This weekend was particularly challenging knowing there was a 250mg adult "apple sauce" packet in the fridge that Ana gave me last Tuesday. 

I truly don't know how long I should step back from THC, but maybe it should be forever. Once I start a break I can generally stick to it for a while, but I'm aware my primary trigger is stress. Whether it's work or life-related, my first instinct is to inhale/ingest some relief (getting stoned).

That aside, I'm about 8 weeks into running at least 3 times a week. I had a small bit of inconsistency around the holidays with travel, but was glad I got right back on that horse when we got home. I've only been a strong runner after intense military training, like bootcamp and SOI, but I've never enjoyed it much so those gains quickly waned. I'm not training for anything in particular, but I think it'd be a good milestone to run a 5K this spring. Right now I'm still doing intervals, starting with a 5 minute jog, 2 minutes of walking, 3 minutes of running... I do that 5 minute run/walk interval 4 times, so in total I'm running non-consecutive minutes in total. I'm having to force myself to take it slow - both because I don't want to injure myself, but also because I don't have a particular goal other than just *feeling* healthy.

I've embraced the mantra **"Discipline is the most advanced form of self-care."** I haven't told anyone this, but I shaved my beard as an outward manifestation of my intention to change my habits for the better.
