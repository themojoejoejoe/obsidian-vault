# Agenda
Sales has developed Grow/Recruit scoring for lead prioritization

Review Questions:

For Grow:

- Baseline filter: 1K+ employees with no Opps and no Customers
    

- Question: are we deciding to move on from going after existing Recruit Customers with Grow? or those are somehow falling in another bucket/score?
    

- You are leveraging significantly 6Sense, 65% of the weight is given to 6Sense metrics
    

- Question: aren't the 6Sense models built mostly on 'Recruit' data? or did we define Grow-specific models?
    

- You are giving 5% weight if they are researching Grow competitors
    

- Comment: it seems that the info you share is missing the criteria for this. It is repeating the Industry criteria
    

- You are giving 20% weight to Industry, only if they are 'NAICS or Industry within A&D or Profession Services'
    

- Comment: we should make sure there is collective alignment on this target for the industry, and that there are no others that might also be a good fit to our solution/successstories
    

- You are giving 10% weight if they are Workday as their ATS
    

  

For Recruit:

- Baseline filter: 1K+ employees with no Opps and no Customers
    
- You are leveraging significantly 6Sense, 70% of the weight is given to 6Sense metrics
    

- Question: isn't it redundant to use all the 6Sense scores and weigh them ourselves? It is my understanding that 6Sense is doing its own internal weight with 'Fit' and '6QA'
    

- 10% to the HR Department budget
    

- Question: where is this intelligence/data point/info coming from? 
    

- 10% to Past 1-year Employee Growth Rate
    

- Question: where is this intelligence/data point/info coming from? 
    

- 10% Number of Recruiters 
    

- Question: where is this intelligence/data point/info coming from? 
    

- General comment/question: 
    

- Should we also give some value to technographic data, looking to acquire into integrations SKUs?
