## MBR Feedback/Ideas
- Tells the story well succinctly, but some parts are not in an easily repeatable format without some heavy lifting
- Format/Flow recommendation:
	- Executive Summary - similar to results overview, but limited to 3-5 slides with one main idea each that weâ€™d want any viewer to remember. Howard would be responsible for compiling and review with each of us ~1 week prior to MBR
	- Key Initiatives - pretty much the same as it currently is, just higher in preso order
	- Channel Specific Results - 1 crosstab view per channel to highlight key metrics
