## Slide Outline

### The importance of attribution for Sales & Marketing Alignment

1. **Clarifies ROI:** Attribution helps both teams understand which efforts generate revenue, enabling them to focus on strategies that provide the highest return on investment.
	1. *Understand what's working and what isn't.*
	
2. **Improves Communication & Facilitates Accountability:** Effective attribution encourages regular communication between sales and marketing, fostering collaboration and the exchange of valuable insights and feedback.
    
4. **Enhances Lead Quality:** By analyzing attribution data, marketing can refine lead generation strategies to deliver higher-quality leads that are more likely to convert, thus benefiting sales.
    
5. **Conserves Resources:**  Identifies underperforming marketing channels or campaigns, helping to eliminate wasteful spending (both budget and internal resource allocation) and reallocating resources to more effective strategies.
	1. *Do more with less*
    
7. **Shortens Sales Cycles:** Sales can tailor their approach based on the marketing channels that generated leads, potentially reducing sales cycles and closing deals faster.
    
8. **Enhances Customer Insights:** Attribution provides valuable data on customer behavior and preferences across entire accounts, aiding both sales and marketing in creating more personalized and effective outreach.
    
9. **Encourages Alignment Goals:** Having a shared understanding of attribution metrics encourages both teams to align their goals around revenue generation and customer acquisition.
    
10. **Drives Continuous Improvement:** Regularly analyzing attribution data allows for ongoing optimization of sales and marketing strategies to adapt to changing market dynamics.
    
11. **Boosts Overall Performance:** When sales and marketing are aligned through attribution, the entire organization can work more efficiently and effectively, ultimately improving overall performance and profitability.
