- How do SDRs feel about UserGems? (i.e. spotty, nice to have, essential, etc.)
	- 100% essential value. 
		- "I think the opportunity for streamlining comes from the Contacts on Closed Lost. Those are the ones that many have never taken demoes with us and flaked, got laid off, quit, etc... if we had to save money anywhere, this is the cohort to cut."
		- Marisa is confused about "Contacts on Closed Won" **Action: to dig in**
- Is the Level of Effort for working these leads generally worth it to SDRs?
	- SDRs would definitely like seeing these.
	- Ones they don't feel like they need to work as hard is when there's an opportunity already they go to the AE. If they're going in a trial, no need. If closed lost recently, no need to get these. Occasssionally this information is good to have but most often there's no opp right now but possibly later.
	- Reviews against 6Sense dashboard and Bombora topics help a lot.
- Is UserGems more performant than any other tools/resources we have at our disposal?
	  - Nope.
