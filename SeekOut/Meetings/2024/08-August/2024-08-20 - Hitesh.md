- how can we work better together to support GTM
	- Core issue: we have a lot of data, built SFDC (and other systems in a reasonable way), but we're either
		- not looking at the data frequently enough
		- Not understanding it
		- Not looking at it the right way
	- example: how many deals did we win by segment? How many had a trial? Did deals slow down from a velocity standpoint?
- Wants to come up with a plan for enabling Chris L, Laura, Lindsay, Hillel to hum in the same direction
- Try to brainstorm solutions on how to help bridge the gap between teams
