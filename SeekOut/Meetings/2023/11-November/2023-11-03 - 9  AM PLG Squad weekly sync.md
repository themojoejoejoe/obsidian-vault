> [!note] Agenda + Notes
> 1. Make a yes/no decision on using a 3rd party tool for interactive product tour for the website
> 2. Discuss the approach for post-sale user onboarding tool.

* Briefly discussed Pre-sales Experiment Map. Largely tabled Agenda Item 1 and action determined for Joe & Laura to fill out to discuss for next meeting to enable faster/more complete decision making
* John: Does not think we should do in product tours.
* Alison: agrees, recommends we incorporate a new user checklist. Has a Q4 priority to revamp home screen, for example:
	* Surfacing checklist for certain period during onboarding
* John: Homepage is useless, nothing to do there. Search page is overwhelming. Desire to make homepage more useful and focused.
* Mike: Recommends guide to provide tour through basic features - like how to use power filters, what various functions mean/can do, and tour of People Insights
* Claire's notes:
	* ![[Pasted image 20231103093419.png]]
* John: "I think we all agree these are things we want users to be able to get to in a couple ways, but we should come to the next meeting with a detailed list of what actually makes the bar and what we will"
	* Next step: document desirable behavior and detail approach of how we inspire that
* Next week Claire is going to find a time later in the week to allow time for above action items (won't be done by Monday)
