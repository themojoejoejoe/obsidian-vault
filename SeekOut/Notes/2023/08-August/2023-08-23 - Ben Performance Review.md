## Strengths

**Functional Expertise** - Everyone on the marketing team reveres Ben's deep subject matter expertise and trust him implicitly to deliver every type of request. From 360: "    If I'm working with him on something, I never have to worry about execution. I know it will be delivered on time and the output quality will be up to my standards."

**Problem-Solving** - Ben has an uncanny knack for making things work and drive for simplicity wherever possible. Every single person who provided feedback for Ben commented on this, one person going so far as to say: "He is always ready to jump in and help (whether asked or not), freakishly fast as well."

## Opportunities

**Leadership** - Due in large part to the trust Ben earns across the team, he has a platform for strategic influence. In larger orgs, he's the kind of person you want building and developing a team of technical experts because he knows his field so well. I  recommend that Ben continues honing his IC expertise while also finding ways to influence and/or edify others around him. No matter what type of role(s) Ben takes in the future, this soft skill development will further set him apart as a trusted expert and business partner.

**Managing Up/Out** - Ben is exceptionally smart and passionate about sharing knowledge. This *occasionally* manifests as overly technical (and correct) explanations that sometimes go over his stakeholder's heads. He shouldn't "dumb it down," because that's not true to who he is, but I would recommend Ben think about ways to contextualize highly technical information in ways that stakeholders more easily understand and avoid using technical jargon when addressing non-technical audiences. Focusing on these skills will 


## RAW FEEDBACK FROM LATTICE
1. What would you say are this employee’s strengths?
2. What is one thing (at least) this employee should start doing?
3. What is one thing (at least) this employee should continue doing?

### SAPNA
Ben is an innovator. He is always looking at making our website easy to navigate, load faster, and optimize it to drive additional pipeline from this top inbound lead source. Ben is always open to trying new ideas while providing strategic guidance from his experience. He can make it happen no matter what requests/ideas people come to him with. He is highly skilled, fast-paced, and has a great sense of humor. He is out there to conquer the world. It's a pleasure to get a chance to work with Ben.
  
With Ben, the ABM team would like to experiment with web personalization for a select few accounts or by industry. I've seen this work and be successful in my past life and would love to try it out at SeekOut. It would be great for Ben to build a journey map for website visitors by persona and type (prospect vs customers). He should suggest what we could do differently to get folks to stay longer on our pages and what would reduce drop-offs.  

Ben should continue to share website analytics and which web pages (top 5) are performing the best. He should continue to suggest processes/technology for our team to keep our operational efficiency high. He should continue to innovate and amaze the team with what's possible!

### SUONG
1. What would you say are this employee’s strengths?  
    Ben has several strengths. The ones that set him apart and make him invaluable to the team are his:

- subject matter expertise
- speed
- problem-solving skills  
    If I'm working with him on something, I never have to worry about execution. I know it will be delivered on time and the output quality will be up to my standards.

2. What is one thing (at least) this employee should start doing?  
    A directive I got from Laura for my own goals is to start working with Ben this quarter to find out how we can drive more organic/direct traffic. So I guess for Ben that translates into " start thinking about how we can drive more organic/direct traffic and be ready to parter with Suong." :)
3. What is one thing (at least) this employee should continue doing?  
    Continue to be a collaborative partner and keep operating at the high level he is.

### VICTORIA
1. **What would you say are this employee’s strengths?**
Outside of bringing his A-Game 24/7 and being the true expert in his field—

**Focusing on the right thing** - Ben is amazing at keeping everything he does with a customer-first approach. He is very intentional about designing/building/proposing anything keeping that charter in mind.

**Dependable** - He is always ready to jump in and help (whether asked or not), freakishly fast as well.

2. **What is one thing (at least) this employee should start doing?**
I would love to see Ben educate the team on best website practices, GA 101, and get us familiar with some standard stats that we should be monitoring.

3. **What is one thing (at least) this employee should continue doing?**
Insert himself whenever there’s a convo about web related anything. He’s very good at doing this and it comes from a genuine place to offer his expertise and do what’s best for the business and the customer.


### SPENCER
1. What would you say are this employee’s strengths?  
    Ben is incredibly talented and collaborative. He is always so willing to help (and quickly) and always has an amazing attitude that makes it so pleasant to work with him.
2. What is one thing (at least) this employee should start doing?  
    Maybe he does this and I just don't see it, but I'd love for Ben to push back when he has too much going on and needs to prioritize. I just worry about him being burned out because he's ALWAYS so willing to help.
3. What is one thing (at least) this employee should continue doing?  
    Ben consistently brings solutions that are beyond simply fulfilling my ask -- this "yeah we can do that, but here's a way we can do it better" approach will help us be inventive and scalable.
