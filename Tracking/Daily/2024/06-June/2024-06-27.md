# Office Hours Notes with Cass re: ChurnZero requirements (Account Scoring)

- Need to balance mixpanel events (actions in seekout), engagement actions (what they do with profiles), and count unique candidates a licensed user has engaged with
- Separate Scores
	- **Adoption** - account level, red/yellow/green averages based on user scores
	- **Engagement Score** – QBR engagement, next meeting booked, etc.
	- **Overall Account Score** – combine adoption, engagement scores & renewal scores.
- Goal: red/yellow/green for every licensed user
	- X% of users on track to help notify/alert to take action when needed
- **Engagmeent Score** - Currently derived from something Cass built in ChurnZero. She's going to document how it works by end of next week
