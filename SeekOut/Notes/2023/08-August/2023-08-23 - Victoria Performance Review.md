## Strengths

**Expertise** - Victoria is a trusted subject matter expert on the marketing team. Much of this expertise is related to the platforms she manages, however Victoria is also a trusted consultant within the team for non-technical considerations. From her 360: "I really appreciate she offers her opinions and expertise on more than just operational work. She is patient and flexible and helpful, which in turn helps my team be more successful." She consistently demonstrates a keen eye for details and innovative ideas for the broader success of the company. Her passion for learning and questioning makes her an expert in her field.

**Energy** – Victoria injects much needed positivity in every project, task, or conversation she's involved in. Her bright, upbeat personality makes her a joy to partner with and is a huge asset for the marketing team. From her 360 feedback: "Victoria brings a high level of energy and enthusiasm to her work... (which allows her to) collaborate effortlessly." From another 360: "I also appreciate Victoria's empathetic nature on the team, as it's always nice to remember that work isn't always heads down and serious." And another: "Her willingness to always help and devote herself to assisting others is an incredibly admirable quality that not only helps her peers but also contributes to the positive atmosphere of our team."

**Education & Enablement** - Victoria consistently demonstrates an ability to simplify complex concepts into teachable moments. She has exemplified this with her recurring education series "The More U Know" as well as in routine office hours and ad hoc support. From 360: "Victoria has also been pivotal in (myself) learning Marketo; she is always patient and willing to thoroughly explain the ins and outs of Marketo."

**Communication** - From Laura: "Victoria is a super strong communicator. She is structured, organized, and very polished, which makes her great at managing out and up. She is highly knowledgeable of her area of expertise and you can tell how she is an invaluable resource for the team to lean into. She collaborates effortlessly and does a great job managing groups, leading discussions and driving alignment." I could not agree more.

## Opportunities

**Leadership** – I think Victoria has high potential to be a leader for our team and company. She is a great role model for those around her, and I would love for her to lean more into that. From her 360: "I would love for Victoria to coach and mentor more Jr members of the team. She has lots to share and she can help elevate our team. I would also love to see Victoria leading strategy and big picture thinking, which she likely has a vision for, but she is not very outspoken about it and she has the opportunity to be seen as marketing leader." 

**Pushing Back** – As a problem solver, Victoria tends to propose solutions and has a really strong knack for doing so successfully. While this unblocks stakeholders in the near term, it does not help them learn how to problem solve on their own nor help her acquire more people management/delegation skills. I would like to see Victoria ask more questions and insist on her stakeholders coming back with clearer plans/requirements/etc., even at the risk of missed stakeholder deadlines.

**Knowledge Sharing** - In part because she's so naturally good at this, and in part because the team has expressed desire to see more educational content from Victoria, I would like to see her lean more into this discipline again. From 360 feedback: "Given that Victoria is really plugged in to the work across the teams, I would love to have her help facilitate more knowledge sharing amongst the team. I know we've found learnings from certain campaigns and nurtures that help influence others and vice versa, and Victoria's position really makes her uniquely suited to help the rest of us connect dots we may not be aware of or see regularly." 



## RAW FEEDBACK FROM LATTICE
1. What would you say are this employee’s strengths?
2. What is one thing (at least) this employee should start doing?
3. What is one thing (at least) this employee should continue doing?

### GINELLE
Victoria brings a high level of energy and enthusiasm to her work. She is always ready to jump in and help, and a trusted marketo expert. Her ability to problem-solve and get things done under pressure has been an asset for the company.

Victoria is excellent in her role, and helpful to many people who ask or need assistance in what they are doing. However, it would be beneficial for her to start delving deeper into understanding marketing and campaign strategies. Although ops does not come up with strategies themselves, understanding the framework and anticpating what they need before they say they need it would give Victoria the ability to move from tactile functions to proposing innovative ideas and initiate improvements that could enhance the teams overall effectiveness that they may not have known could be done.

Victoria should continue being herself as she is. She shows up to work, always has a smile on her face, and is someone that people can trust to get things done. I appreciate her thoroughness and questions she ask pre and post projects.

### JAMES
1. Victoria is a great partner on the MOPs team. I really appreciate she offers her opinions and expertise on more than just operational work. She is patient and flexible and helpful, which in turns helps myself and my team be more successful.
2. Given that Victoria is really plugged in to the work across the teams, I would love to have her help facilitate more knowledge sharing amongst the team. I know we've found learnings from certain campaigns and nurtures that help influence others and vice versa, and Victoria's position really makes her uniquely suited to help the rest of us connect dots we may not be aware of or see regularly.
3. Victoria should continue bringing her Marketo expertise to the forefront wherever possible. Keep informing the team(s) of shortcuts, workarounds, new features or systems changes that help us all be more efficient in our work.

### BEN

She consistently demonstrates a keen eye for details and innovative ideas for the broader success of the company. Her passion for learning and questioning makes her an expert in her field.
2. **What is one thing (at least) this employee should start doing?** In my eyes, Victoria would thrive in taking on a greater degree of ownership in her programs. With her attention to detail and innovative ideas, she could lead the business with more focus and maintain her high standard of output. Having full autonomy and ownership of her programs to maintain focus and achieve her and the business' goals would be critical.
3. **What is one thing (at least) this employee should continue doing?** Victoria should continue to be the compassionate and dedicated team member she is known for being. Her willingness to always help and devote herself to assisting others is an incredibly admirable quality that not only helps her peers but also contributes to the positive atmosphere of our team.

2. What is one thing (at least) this employee should start doing? I think Victoria has high potential to be a leader for our team and company.

I would also love to see Victoria leading strategy and big picture thinking, which she likely has a vision for, but she is not very outspoken about it and she has the opportunity to be seen as marketing leader. I feel she is very comfortable within her team, which is great, but she would benefit from more exposure
3. What is one thing (at least) this employee should continue doing? continue being a thorough problem solver and having the highest standards of excellence for herself and the team. Also, continue being an amazing team player and collaborator. The team really looks up to Victoria

### GENGEN
1. Victoria brings a logical, well-thought-out approach to any project or initiative we have worked on - often being the reminder of all foundational items that should be considered when the team is moving fast. Victoria has also been pivotal in (myself) learning Marketo; she is always patient and willing to thoroughly explain the ins and outs of Marketo. I also appreciate Victoria's empathetic nature on the team, as it's always nice to remember that work isn't always heads down and serious.
2. I'd love to see Victoria do more mentorship/teaching and/or leading meetings! I've appreciated learning from her as she reminds me of some amazing people managers I've had in the past. With her holistic approach to projects, I also think our team could benefit from Victoria being more vocal about her concerns or thoughts on our activities.
3. I appreciate Victoria's dedication during bar-raising tickets (mine and others) to explain and teach requesters how to fix their programs/emails/etc. From when I started to now, I have seen more marketing teammates change from Marketo-'dislikers' to enthusiasts, and I think that comes from Victoria's explanations and knowing her audience.

### ERIN H
1. Victoria is a wonderfully collaborative business partner. She is always willing to help, asks important and clarifying questions, and isn't afraid to set boundaries and expectations where necessary to ensure we are focused on driving the best results. She does so always with a very friendly and collaborative approach.
2. I love that Victoria is very data-driven and I think there's more opportunity for her to share broader results and feedback about our email campaigns and channels and use that to help drive business objectives and best practices.
3. Victoria has a wonderful way of working - she can get things done and set clear boundaries but do so in a very friendly and collaborative manner. She is really good at bringing folks along on the journey and using data to support decision making.
