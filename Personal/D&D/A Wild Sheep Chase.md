## Cold Open
It is a peaceful time in the city of Baldur's Gate. A recent cultist uprising has been quelled, and roadside banditry has become more of a memory than an ever-present threat.

You are currently enjoying a meal with your fellow party members. A clattering rises down the cobblestone streets. You hear the sounds of guards shouting, children laughing, and â€“ bleating? The cacophony builds to a crescendo as you realize whatever is causing this ruckus is heading your way.

Before you anyone can get up from the table, a white shape lumbers towards you. Upon closer inspection, you realize this beast appears to be a regular sheep in every way: fluffy white coat, black face, curled horns... But it's carrying something in its mouth.

The sheep sidles up to [insert mage character name] and attempts to deposit a warm, wet piece of crumpled parchment in their hand, gesticulating in wide-eyed enthusiasm that it wants you to take this from him.
