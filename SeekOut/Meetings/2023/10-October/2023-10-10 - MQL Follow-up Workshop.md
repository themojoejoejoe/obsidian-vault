## Current State

![[Pasted image 20231010131257.png]]

- *Closed Lost* - quarterly review of CL Opps for follow-up
- *Referrals* - UserGems
* *"Nurtures"* - bi-annual or quarterly folllow-ups, not a true nurture experience

![[Pasted image 20231010133102.png]]
- For Closed Lost Reconnect, we discussed not fully automating but incorporating 6QA as a qualifier for intent

![[Pasted image 20231010133249.png]]
- Outbound or 6QA
- Review Criteria:
	- Title
	- LinkedIn History (job role/level assessment)

Meghan
> Next year, I would like Sales to be organized against 6QAs for setting target accounts

- Shift from "lists" to "criteria"

> [!error] IDK Just Joelo It
> Double check integration to understand if Marketo is directly connected and why a form submitter would be "unknown" to 6Sense

***Meghan Desired State: Automate the creation of 6QA records and incorporate into SDR's daily queues***

### Nurtures
- New Records
	- Block from adding to nurture for 1 week
		- If they move to TAL, continue excluding
- Warm Records (form fills)
	- Get emails as normal
	- 
- Hot Records (Handraises & Auto-MQLs)

> [!todo] Action Items

- [ ] Account Scoring related to 6Sense "Fit"
- [ ] Investigate how orchestrations create contacts
- [ ] Pixar - Update new lead logic for when members are added (Pause TALs)
