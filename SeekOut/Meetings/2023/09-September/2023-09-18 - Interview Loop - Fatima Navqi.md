1. **Give me an example of a time when you were able to deliver an important launch under a tight deadline**. What sacrifices did you have to make to meet the deadline? How did they impact the final deliverable? What was the final outcome?

When Fatima joined HireEZ, one of her first projects was to revamp the website. Her CEO gave her 6 weeks to do so. They initially had an agency because they wouldn't be able to facilitate the deadline and would be better to do themselves. She convinced CEO to extend deadline to 8 weeks (+2). They used HireEZ to find a developer/designer and leveraged her and a "couple people from the marketing team" to create the content. She worked with the CRO on the messaging and understanding personas, segments and what was/was not working. 

Results: doubled qualified leads, traffic increased by 30%, and time on site improved by (she gave a number of seconds and I missed it). 

*Prompt: Why wasn't the agency able to facilitate the deadline?*

Agency said they would do it in 10 weeks. As they started working, they inflated the timeline to 16 weeks. CRO decided it had to be faster. "Company culture was very fast - 'just get things done.'"

*Prompt: how did you scope the 8-week timeline? What sort of sacrifices did you have to make to support that?

Long nights, did not balance work and life during that time. On the work side, she had to deprioritize sales enablement tasks/projects while she supported this project.

*Prompt: anything you'd do different?*

Factors outside her control, like the company culture, decision makers... She would take that experience and showcase the benefits of being more thoughtful with what updates they were making. She would also bake in more testing to the launch to understand effects.

2. **Tell me about a time when a product you brought to market had a pipeline/revenue target you were tasked with delivering.** What stakeholders did you partner with internally? What unexpected learnings did you uncover? What would you do differently next time?

Have not been directly responsible for pipeline or revenue targets. 

Launched ATS Talent Rediscovery product at HireEZ. She was a founding PMM and there were no processes. It was her first solo PMM role and she had to create the processes and standards. Her first step was to establish a framework: how would we do launches? That was helpful to build out the sizing in terms of tiers. She also lined out the RACI model for each launch. She was clear that she owned the launch and coordinationg of the launch, but she was not accountable for revenue/pipeline impact. 

Partnered with 3 customers to gain feedback on the feature and the messaging. Used this feedback to refine the GTM plan. As she gave updates to new features coming up in the launch syncs, she showcased the content she was developing while also facilitating requirements for what Sales needed to deliver results. She used Monday.com to track all the deliverables and component tasks.

As they got closer to launch, she set up a couple trainings between sales and engineering where she would explain the framework of Personas and the problem, proof points, competitors, etc., then hand over to the PM/Engineer to do a demo, then have Q&A.

Reached 60% of adoption goal. The metric they were focused on was # of candidates being imported to HireEZ.  

In hindsight, she would have loved to have better telemetry on product usage data. This would have helped her advocate for further enhancements based on how early adopters were using it (or not). 


3. **Tell me about a time when you had significant, unanticipated obstacles to overcome in achieving a goal?** What was the obstacle? Were you eventually successful? Knowing what you know now, is there anything you would have done differently?



4. **Tell me about a time when you were trying to understand a complex problem on your team and you had to dig into the details to figure it out.** Who did you talk with or where did you have to look to find the most valuable information? How did you use that information to help solve the problem?

At Laurel, she joined the company as the first PMM. The problem she saw was a lack of trust and friction. There were features her GTM team had asked for but hadn't been built. She looked into why these features were not prioritized. With the engineering team, she uncovered that there were hard-to-explain technical issues that made the ask harder to do than understood by other groups.

To establish more trust and bidirectional comms, she created a mechanism to provide written bi-weekly updates, shorter weekly recap emails, and more pulse check meetings.
