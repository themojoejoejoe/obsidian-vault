>[!abstract] AGENDA
>1.  **Celebrate our wins** – what have we delivered in the past trailing 4 quarters?
>2. **Inventory of current business challenges vs priorities** – What’s the state of the business? What recurring challenges have we encountered, and do we have paths around them?
>3.  **Define key objectives** – In support of the big 3 goals, what can Ops do to impact them? This is a brainstorming session where we’ll consider each goal and potential projects that can support them
>4. **Review the full list** – We already have  [a running list](https://zipstorm.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/MarketingTeamSite/EVou6ZX3VQlEq_mKxXxDjTIBiMMe2CVlPfGpb5th8gw_6w?e=uaPW1d "https://zipstorm.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/MarketingTeamSite/EVou6ZX3VQlEq_mKxXxDjTIBiMMe2CVlPfGpb5th8gw_6w?e=uaPW1d") and by this point it’ll be even longer. What work do we want to prioritize and what should we backlog?
>5.  **One team, one mission** – Elephant in the room is we have different intake and prioritization methods. As we come together as a team, I want us to be intentional about thinking through the best processes we can adopt to set a standard for other teams/departments, and also support maintaining focus on the work that matters most to our customers.
>6. **Dinner/Event** – still working on logistics for what we can swing for the locals but ideas welcome.
