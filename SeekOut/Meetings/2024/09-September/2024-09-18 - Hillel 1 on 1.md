- Stage gates
	- Opportunity Stage Gates to stamp out the behavior that we are not making a positive case for SeekOut and trying to renew them.
	- Don't want to penalize anyone, but want to show how AEs and CSMs work together, when/how is SLT being involved, how many dollars are we covering?
	- Only for renewal or expansion opps, 3 yes/no questions that determine if an opp can move forward
- Thorntale
	- AI-based data visualization/automation to support WBR/MBR/QBR on an automated basis for TechTouch use cases
	- Connects to Snowflake, not yet available for Tableau
	- They'll do all the slide design for us
