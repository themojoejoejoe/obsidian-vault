1. **CSAT Scores + Comments** ([in progress](https://zipstorm-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/molly_carlton_seekout_com/EW_lRwKw3SBGoVmdhjBxcSYBloQlYEVPrIZKvH8Qy4V2FA?e=xp1O0T))
2. **Win/Loss Analysis** – Surveying closed-lost deals can provide rich evidence on where they decided SeekOut was not best for their needs. This could be a breakdown in sales process, not building enough trust, inadequate content, etc. While we can absolutely do win/loss interviews in a targeted manner, surveying gives us repetitive scale and feedback that drives win rate higher.
3. **Surveying Recruit** – The primary theme of detracting CHRO’s that reviewed our Grow product detail page cited the absence of quantitative proof points that Grow is effective. While generating multi-year ROI case studies takes multiple years, other companies are touting quotes about their sales process, or positive gains from before/after deployment (e.g. “74% of employees say they are aware of more internal opportunities than before”. Statistics like this build trust both early in the sales cycle before prospects have talked to a seller and doing their own research, as well as near the end when buyers look for elements to de-risk their purchase.
4. **Power User Usage Analysis** – While we do have some data from product usage that demonstrates volume and frequency of usage, we do not get qualitative data when a customer is a power user or drops off in usage that help us understand why. We are likely missing some low-hanging fruit on this that could help keep users highly engaged in product, increasing their CLTV.
