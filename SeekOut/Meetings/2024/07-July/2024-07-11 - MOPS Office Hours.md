Cass joined to discuss Account Health next steps
- They've finalized what they want to analyze
- They want everything to live in SFDC
- Still looking on the user level. Requesting 3 new fields for licensed users
	- total actioned profiles
		- can we count unique profiles engaged or just total events? The latter is fine, but former is preferred
	- total number of HVA Types
	- total number of HVA events
- With those metrics, are they green/yellow/red? True/false criteria?

- At account level, would like a field to know % of license users who are "green"
- Anecdotally, Ian had previously found "green" to be ~70% or more of engagement with a given HVA event
