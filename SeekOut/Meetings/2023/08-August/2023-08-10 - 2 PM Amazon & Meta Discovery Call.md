## Meta
ND = "AM", but it's a house account ND is overseeing temporarily. He'll be talking to Kristin soon about how to reassign (in next 2 weeks.) Alison Hammerand supports but was former AM for Meta.

Overview:
* Used to have 3K users, usage was high, happy customer
* After layoffs, they asked us to blackout marketing comms earlier this year
* No proactive outreach possible, no outreach *from* Meta to us
* Renewal Jan 15, 2024, decision expected October timeframe
* Teams asked to cut spending by 15-20%
* ~500 people should have licenses
	* Getting a list of people who should/should not have access
* Currently tracking ~100 user logins/month
* No notification for when users leave, licenses are simply reprovisioned internally
	* Matt gets a list monthly and removes those users
	* Matt Request: Can we provide new users with getting started notifications?
* Success Criteria to Renew: Not a defined number, but it used to be 500 active users/month. 
	* It *is* # of unique active users, just not decided what that should be

## Amazon
Andrew = AM

Overview:

* Reorganized team this year and have asked us to be sensitive about outreach during layoffs
* 2nd largest partner ARR-wise
* AWS has unlimited licenses, but other orgs have a set limit
* Amazon looking to cut all ELAs next year
* 600 licenses. Active in the platform for past 1-2 months is 100-200
* Success Criteria: determining renewal size based on utilization. Only planning on renewing ~200 licenses
* Lack of clarity to # of people who *could* have a license


## Both companies:
* In terms of platform preference, we are #3 behind LinkedIn & HireEZ
* Potential appetite to expand beyond recruiters and to other hiring managers
