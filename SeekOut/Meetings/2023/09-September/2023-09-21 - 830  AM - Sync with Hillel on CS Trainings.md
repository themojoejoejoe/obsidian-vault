Synced on the results we're seeing from the Live training series. 

Ultimately didn't go anywhere. Hillel views the situation as us blocking them and not offering an alternative path forward. I challenged him to justify the resources, specifically "how does the business benefit from doing this manually that it doesn't from doing it automated?"

## Follow-up sync with Laura

# Executive Summary

**Summary:** Marketing and Customer Success (CS) have partnered on delivering live customer trainings since August 2022. Across the tiered courses, we host 10 live trainings each month. From a headcount resource standpoint, this level of effort currently represents 8.5% - 11.7% of an FTE each month.

We are not currently seeing a significant difference among adoption or retention among accounts who attend these trainings versus those who do not ([link](https://zipstorm.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/mops/EdLbYbvJfx9DnAqnk7GEY08Bt6W_OPkvbNnev6MSfUNGnA?e=GCAgVB)). To help the business scale and refocus internal resources on other business challenges, Marketing Operations has identified 3 potential paths forward:

1. ***Full Automation*** â€“ This approach requires some up-front program construction but effectively eliminates ongoing reoccurring FTE impact. We would still recommend periodic review and optimization updates, but those would not necessarily be time sensitive.
	1. *Pros:* Reduced tech/operational debt across CS and MOPs teams, freeing both teams to focus on other initiatives. Ability to include these events in evergreen nurture series related to adoption and onboarding.
	2. *Cons:* Removal of a "human touch" and associated relationship building. 
2. ***Optional On-Demand*** â€“ Within our current landing pages, customers can select a specific session date they would like to attend. In this approach, we would also add a "watch now" option to this menu selection so both instructor-led and on-demand trainings would be accessible to any user.
	1. *Pros:* Enables customer choice/preference.
	2. *Cons:* Does not change level of manual efforts required to maintain live trainings. 
3. ***A/B Split Test*** - When we send emails inviting new customers to this event, we could have a random sample test so 50% of the audience receives a link to the on demand training and the other half receives the live training experience.
	1. *Pros*: Leverages a best practice test design, cohorted by time of invitation send.
	2. *Cons*: Slightly increases level of manual efforts required to maintain live trainings.

**Recommendation:**  Given that the past 13 months of performance data does not indicate any potential negative impacts to customer adoption or retention, the MOPs team has a strong bias towards fully automating live trainings by converting them to on-demand experiences. We believe this creates more opportunities for marketing and CS to prioritize other initiatives with broader impact (do more with less) and also create other opportunities for these teams to partner on results that impact customer renewals, expansion, and churn deflection.
