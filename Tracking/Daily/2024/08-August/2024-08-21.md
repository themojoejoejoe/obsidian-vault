# CS Notes
* Overly strong focus on perfection vs good enough
* Tone
* "Blocked" from using scoring
* Vague requirements
* Outsourcing of cognitive load
* There needs to be a single clear metric for accountability
	* Ginelle: i.e. this quarter, these are the most important things we need to deliver on

Guidance on how to look at data
- Looked at YoY data with Hitesh and saw we won more deals this quarter than this quarter last year, but deal size has shrunk significantly. ASP is shrinking despite winning more deals and qualifying more deals
- 

* **GTM Scorecard** - create a recommendation of what our northstar metrics are and how we're making progress towards them within 1-2 weeks
	* Make a part of the weekly standup
	* Monthly we do a deeper dive
* Do our CSMs know if they're on track or not?
* Monthly deep dive - to be 100% aligned on what we need to do
*
