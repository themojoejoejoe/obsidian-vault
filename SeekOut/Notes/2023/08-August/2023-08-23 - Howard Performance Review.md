## Strengths
**Expertise** - Howard's subject matter expertise, from technical platform knowledge to raw analytical ability, is top notch. The most obvious evidence of this is how multiple teams have come to rely on his support. From 360: "Howard is an exceptional analyst with the ability to manage, balance, and prioritize a diverse range of requests with class and poise. his efforts have significantly enhanced the company's data literacy and have revealed crucial areas for improvement."

**Objectivity** - Howard has no agenda when presenting data and maintains a "just the facts" rapport with stakeholders and leaders alike. This is *hugely valuable* to the marketing analytics function. From 360: "While handling such business critical data, Howard is able to offer his professional opinion without any personal bias or influence from others. I appreciate his professionalism and commitment to data integrity."

**Ability to Simplify** - Many of our stakeholders are inexperienced when it comes to analytics and reporting, and Howard has a knack for simplifying complex concepts into digestible information. From 360: "Howard has the ability to streamline unstructured data and put it to good use. I appreciate his guidance on reporting from the past year to be able to forecast realistic goals."

**Collaboration** - Everyone loves working with you and has a high degree of confidence that you deliver everything you say you will. This level of trust is paramount to not only the perception of marketing operations at SeekOut, but also provides a level of security and safety for the marketing team as priorities shift. Howard exudes calm and he's generally unfazed by the vagaries of b2b SaaS. From 360: His diligence, ability to work under pressure while maintaining a positive attitude, and commitment to his work are truly inspiring. His work ethic serves as a great model for the rest of the team." Another: "Howard is rock-steady, I love that he's unflappable in the face of things that are very flappable. He's so calm and patient." 


## Opportunities
**Proactive Recommendations** - As we shift from initial platform/report configurations to more strategic initiatives, there's an opportunity for Howard to lean into taking on a more advisory partner role for the marketing team. From 360: "While Howard has already started doing this, I would love to see him take an even more active role in making recommendations for what we should start/stop/continue doing as a marketing team. His data-backed insights and objectivity provide a unique perspective that could guide us in deciding how we focus." 

**"Reporting for Dummies"** -  Not that we view our stakeholders as dummies, this was a direct quote from a 360 feedback. But it was interesting that it came up from a couple people that our "mall directory" idea was good, but in need of an upleveling or reset. From 360: "As we mature as a marketing org and finalize what success metrics we will track for each channel, I'd love to see a guide/FAQ asset of exactly which reports we should use when we're trying to report on X."



## RAW FEEDBACK FROM LATTICE
1. What would you say are this employee’s strengths?
2. What is one thing (at least) this employee should start doing?
3. What is one thing (at least) this employee should continue doing?

### SAPNA
Howard has been instrumental in helping us clean and transform our data for analysis and reporting on results. His weekly reports on how we are pacing towards our MQL and pipeline goals are very helpful. He is an expert at Tableau reports and always willing to help everyone navigate through Tableau. Howard has the ability to streamline unstructured data and put it to good use. I appreciate his guidance on event reporting from the past year to be able to forecast realistic goals for the upcoming quarters.

It would be great for Howard to find a way of how we could consistently report whether it is out of SFDC or Tableau. I would love to run some deal acceleration reporting ideas by Howard and see how we could bring them to life, especially for our Field events. It would be helpful to understand lead quality by channel and any trends he may have noticed of leads by age so we can take that into account for forecasting.

Howard should continue sending weekly reports on what drives pipeline and sources that are helping us get to the desired pipeline results. He should continue to innovate on reporting capabilities since he's helped us come a long way!

    Howard is rock-steady, I love that he's unflappable in the face of things that are very flappable. He's so calm and patient - if he's annoyed by my many slacks asking for help/confirmation, he never shows it.

1. **What would you say are this employee’s strengths?**

**Patience -** Howard stays kind, patient, and unflustered even with the gazillion, time-sensitive asks the come his way on a daily basis.

**Unbiased -** While handling such business critical data, Howard is able to offer his professional opinion without any personal bias or influence from others. I appreciate his professionalism and commitment to data integrity.

He is also just such a nice person!! He makes everyone feels safe and comfortable.

2. **What is one thing (at least) this employee should start doing?**
Go through all the dashboard he’s built to see which ones are not being utilized. Would love to have that data point plus the requester so we can help him prioritize incoming reporting asks.

Work with me or Joe on creating a tutorials for the top dashboards stakeholders so they become more self serve vs asking him one-off questions.

3. **What is one thing (at least) this employee should continue doing?**
Flag data anomalies or anything that doesn’t pass the gut check.
