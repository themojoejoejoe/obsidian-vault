> [!note] Agenda + Notes
>***Situation:*** Account Managers were/are ignoring MQLs because they don't know what to do with them or how to work them. Kristin & Meghan decided to route those to the SDRs so they could follow up (this has been active for ~2 months)
> ***Result***: Many questions from SDRs - they are not empowered to follow-up and end up being a middle person coordinating with AMs
> ***Current:*** Chris is working with AMs on process for them to follow-up on MQLs

	- Marketing holds it until they request a demo (only hand raises would be routed)
- **We have an opportunity/need to propose a more efficient process to maximize Sales Ops efficiency in FY25**
