Prior to dropping sage advice on topics ranging from serious to silly, my dad is fond of saying: "free advice is worth its price." He says this as a sort of qualifier for the perspective he's about to deliver, and over time I've learned there's an understood message like "hey this would've been useful to me to know the first time I was in a situation like yours, but you'll have to weigh the value of this for yourself to see if it applies."

He's never said this because he was unsure of his views or whether or not they were valid in another situation. Rather, his intent was to convey humility while offering a genuine, earned perspective. He has never presumed he was or is objectively correct in anything, which invites a certain type of introspection and discourse. In a world where so many strive for recognition as a pundit or a "thought leader" for the purpose of getting rich, this behavior is unheard of and borderline nonsensical. 

Enter: this narrative.

I'm going to level with you at the outset: no one knows all the answers or has access to objective universal truths as far as the human condition is concerned. If someone did, the world would truly be a utopia. This shouldn't discourage you though; it should *empower* you. You're not going to uncover some sort of philosophical panacea reading this book. You might even flat out disagree with some of the perspectives offered. I'm telling you right here, right now, inside the first 500 words: that's okay. 

Also, putting genuine good faith and helpfulness into the universe while not charging a dime *and* paying homage to your Pops is punny as hell and I'm here for it. If we show up for each other consistently and without regard for our own egos or ethos, what can stand against us?

Nothing.

Love is timeless, and this book is born out of love. It is my sincere hope that the words in these pages inspire you to think, compare, and adapt your own paradigm accordingly. Maybe some of the sagacious lessons I've learned along the way will help you chart a course for your life. Maybe it's just more literary dross. At the end of the day, this book is for the young or the uncertain to help them think along more seasoned and/or resolved lines.

Above all else, please remember those groups are not mutually exclusive. Old and experienced humans can still be unsure of anything and everything. The person saying this to you right now is all-too-cognizant that he doesn't know everything, and his own perspective have shifted dramatically over the years. I'm just here to tell you that free advice is *generally* worth its price... but sometimes it's priceless.

Which is why this work is gratis.
