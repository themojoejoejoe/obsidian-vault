Purpose is to align on what we define as "high value actions" in the SeekOut product

## Provided Previously in a doc:

**Base HVAs**
* Add to Project
* Get contact info
* Export (one or more) candidates OR Start outreach campaign
* Things you can't do on LinkedIn (TYCDOLI)
	* Diversity Search
	* Power Filters
	* Cloning
	* Using the other indexes (where available)
	* SeekOut Assist search
* People Insights
* Add a filter (or manage filters)

**More Advanced HVAs**
* Sharing project
* Annotating candidate (note, tag, comment)
* Exporting entire project
* Exporting insights
* adding more than 10(?) candidates to a project
* Getting contact info for more than 10(?) candidates
* SeekOut specific Boolean (field-based, etc.)
* Using OR in a smart match

## Status Quo & Future State

Need to coordinate "the experience" end to end and what will come from where (Marketo, ChurnZero, in-app, etc.)

Cass said they were okay with not building in ChurnZero if another platform makes more sense.
