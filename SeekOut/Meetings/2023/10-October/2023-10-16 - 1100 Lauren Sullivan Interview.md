- **Give me an example of how you have changed the direction or view of a specific function/department and helped them embrace a new way of thinking.** Why was the change needed? What was the outcome?

At Zillow, Lauren was a web strategist. At that time, they were very siloed, but really successful within that structure. As she started meeting with other marketers, she realized there was a need for a broader strategy across all marketing. The change was needed because marketing didn't view performance web as a core metric for marketing success (they viewed it as more of a brand play). ~40 people creating pages randomly with no consistency, missing analytics, and other technical components. Lauren "gathered" the troops to show performance over the past 2 years and made a proposal to create more structure for performance based web publishing.

Consolidated 500 pages down to ~150. Grew the revenue team to 6 people. Also moved people into a design framework and she worked with them to make sure design worked with performance model. 

Result: huge mindset shift for marketing on what they focused on. Multi-family rentals saw big improvement to CVR, product usage metrics went up, SEO improved ~15% after 6 months.

We = Lauren + her team of directs.


- **Tell me about a time when you thought differently to improve a process that was working.** What assumptions did you have to question? How did you evaluate if the change improved the process? Knowing what you know now, would you do anything differently?

Multi-step form for Zillow's B2B model on form-based pages. When Lauren started, they originally had LPs with basic forms. They tested the normal stuff (headlines, form, imagery, etc.)

*Idea:* *What if we tried a multi-step form?*

Zillow had never done this before and had nothing to compare it to. She's seen it on other B2B sites and had some stats from case studies. She formulated a plan and socialized it with technical resources to create an initial POC. Improved CVR by 3.5 BPS and quality of leads were also higher 

*What would you do differently?*

Initially deployed without heatmap tracking. Lauren decided to test without because it required additional technical scoping. In hindsight she would've gone ahead and done this to produce more data. 

Also found that multi-step forms did not work well for Paid. They did a lot of A/B and experience optimization testing.

- **Describe a time when you brought different perspectives together to solve a problem.** What types of different perspectives were represented? How did you seek out different points of view? What was the outcome? Where there any key learnings from this experience? Knowing what you know now, would you have done anything different?
