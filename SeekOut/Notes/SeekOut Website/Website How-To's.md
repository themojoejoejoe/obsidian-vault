## Creating a new page
- There are three ways that pages are created on the website:
	- 1. Pages are auto-generated for page routes titled [slug].js
	- 2. Pages are auto-generated by a test for page routes titled [bucket].js
	- 3. Pages are created by the user (you) by manually creating a page route
- All pages published to the marketing website are with the "/pages" folder in website repo:

- To manually create a page—first choose the path. Paths are represented by (and are) folders. If you want a URL like seekout.com/resources/programs/my-cool-page, create a file within the /pages/resources/programs folder of the repo.
	- Files can either be TypeScript or Javascript (.ts or .js), by default—I mostly use .js since not everything is necessary to be type-safe in pages.
- Once you have a page, you can either leverage another page that you duplicate off of or create a new structure. 
- The Content component does a LOT of heavy lifting. It takes in many different types of content and inputs from Contentful and uses the correct component for those. Typically you can pass much of the *landingPage.fields.contentSections* elements and parses those to their respective sections.
	- Pages are typically made up of:
		- Hero
		- Content
		- Additional resources (optional)
		- Next Steps
	- These elements generally should feed from Contentful as a source of the content, but don't necessarily *have* to
	- For most pages, you can duplicate a page and just drop in the entry ID from Contentful, and that will work to generate the page with that content.

## Deleting a page
If you delete a page, just delete the file, add a redirect if there's still traffic going to the page and push both changes to the brand then merge. Approve pull request.

## Updating a page
- If change is to backend information: select branch to make change in, confirm changes, merge changes, approve pull request.
- If change is in Contentful: make change, wait 0-15 minutes (generally revalidation is set at 900s across all pages—which is 15 minutes). If changes need to be immediate, redeploy in Vercel:![[Pasted image 20230828174020.png]]
