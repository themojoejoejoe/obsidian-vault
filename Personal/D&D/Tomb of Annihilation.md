## Session 1  –  6/9/2024

### OPENING

> For the past several days, the talk of the streets and taverns has all been about the so-called death curse: a wasting disease afflicting everyone who’s ever been raised from the dead. Victims grow thinner and weaker each day, slowly but steadily sliding toward the death they once denied. When they finally succumb, they can’t be raised — and neither can anyone else, regardless of whether they’ve ever received that miracle in the past. Temples and scholars of divine magic are at a loss to explain a curse that has affected the entire region, and possibly the entire world.

**Break to allow players to introduce themselves and explain why they are together**

> You have been invited to the home of Syndra Silvane, a retired adventurer and merchant. A uniformed attendant leads you up a grand staircase to the third floor, then ushers you into a wood-paneled room with a fireplace, comfortable chairs, and a heavy table bearing goblets and bottles of wine. The darkly paneled walls are hung with maps and sea charts. Racks, shelves, and cabinets hold hundreds more rolled-up maps and charts.
> 
>A person is seated in an overstuffed chair near the fire. You can’t discern a gender, because only the person’s head emerges from under a heavy blanket draped over the chair, and an embroidered hood and silver mask conceal the wearer’s face. Even the person’s dry, raspy voice provides no clue. “Help yourselves to wine, and seat yourselves, friends — I hope I may call you that.

Syndra relays the following in narrative form:

- “I was an adventurer years ago. I died once and was raised from the dead. I have since closed the door on that stage of my life.”
- “The death curse you’ve heard about has struck me. I don’t know how much longer I’ll last before I perish. Clerics have no help to offer. They’re stymied by what is happening.”
- “My contacts in the Harpers have learned that the cause of the death curse is a necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger. According to their sources, the Soulmonger is somewhere in Chult.”
- “Chult is a peninsula ringed with mountains and choked with rain forests. Enormous reptiles, hostile goblins, and an army of undead prowl its jungles and ruins. Mapping the place has always been nigh impossible, and nothing is known about the region’s current geography beyond a few miles from the coast.”
- “Working from dozens of sea charts, log books, and explorers’ journals, I assembled everything known about the current state of Chult into one map. I’ll provide it to you if you undertake my mission.”
- “When you’re ready to depart, I will teleport us all to Port Nyanzaru, the only major settlement in Chult. I’ve been there several times before, so there’s little chance of mishap. Once there, I’ll stay with a friend named Wakanga O’tamu. He’s one of seven merchant princes who rule the city.”

Once teleported to Port Z:

>You appear in a tropical city under the blazing sun. The familiar sounds of a harbor — creaking ropes, slapping waves, heavy barrels rolling across cobblestones — mingle with voices shouting and cursing in an unfamiliar language filled with clicks, inhalations, and singsongy words that make it sound almost musical. The aroma of unfamiliar spices and tropical fruit mixes with the wharfside smells of fish, tar, and canvas.
>
>Beyond all that, Port Nyanzaru is an explosion of color. Buildings are painted in bright shades of blue, green, orange, and salmon pink, or their walls are adorned with murals portraying giant reptiles and mythical heroes. Every building sports baskets and clay urns of colorful flowers or is draped in leafy, flowering vines. Minstrels in bright clothing adorned with feathers and shells perform on street corners. Multicolored pennants and sun awnings flutter atop the city walls. A crowd of children dressed in feathered hats and capes races past you, squealing in delighted terror as a street performer costumed as a big-toothed lizard stomps and roars behind them. The whole city seems to be bustling, sweating, laughing, swearing, and singing.

Syndra says:
> Welcome to Port Nyanzaru, adventurers. The Merchan'ts Ward is where you'll find the markets and the homes of the merchant princes, while the Old City holds the echoes of Chult's ancient past. Beyond, the Red Bazaar offers everyday goods, and the towering temples on Temple Hill stand as beacons of faith and fortune.
> 
> As for me, I am going to find my friend Wakanga O'tembe, one of the Merchant Princes. You are welcome to accompany me or go your own way.

## Session 2 - 6/16/2024

*Previously, in Tomb of Annihilation...*
LOu
> Your newly formed adventuring party first met at the mansion of one Syndra Sylvane - an archmage former adventurer affected by the so called "death curse." She informed you that not only were people who were previously resurrected now.. *wasting away*... but also that resurrection magic no longer seemed to work anywhere in Faerun. She tasked you with adventuring to the rumored source of this curse, somewhere deep in the jungles of Chult - a distant land known for dinosaurs, insect-born diseases, and little else.
> 
> You each have your own reasons for joining this quest. Whether to find a missing family member, gain fame, or otherwise, you all agreed to search for the cause of this Death Curse and to do what you can to cure it. 
> 
> You followed Syndra to her friend Wakanga's mansion. You learned he was one of the 7 merchant princes of Chult, who are sort of the defacto leaders of the city. He gave you some info about the other merchant princes and recommended a few sites in the city for you to explore: namely, the Grand Souk, the Old CIty, and of course the dinosaur races on the south side of the city. He agreed to arrange a meeting for you with Jobal tomorrow to discuss guides and other exploration necessities. 
> 
> In the meantime, you decided to kill time at the dinosaur races to try to earn some extra gold to fund your adventure! Law used her druidic powers to speak to a triceratops named Ubtao's Favorite. After initially offering to gore other dinosaur's for a reward of multiple hay bales, Law eventually just asks him to try his best. The Unchained Race begins soon. What would you like to do?

### Goals for this Session
- Meet with Jobal and select a guide
- direct the party to side quests
	- Jarek - Old City 
	- Zindar - Harbormaster
	- Omala - 

### Session Notes

## Session 3 - 6/23/2024

*Previously, in Tomb of Annihilation*

> Your party of intrepid adventurers plunged into the heart of Port Nyanzaru's vibrant culture, starting with the thrilling dinosaur races! Amidst the roar of the crowd and the thunderous stomps of the racing dinosaurs, you placed bets and emerged victorious... mostly... pocketing a handsome sum of gold. The jubilant atmosphere of the city was palpable, but you were also keen to seek further excitement and profit.
> 
> Your next move was to visit the harbormaster, Zindar, at his office in the docks. You inquired about a lucrative quest: the capture of 3 notorious pirate ships and their captains... who would offer an additional bonus if you managed to bring in alive. Zindar seemed to recognize your potential and offered to spar with you. The party bravely faced him in combat, but Zinda'rs sheer power and draconic prowess overwhelmed them. With a single, deft move, he brought the party to their knees.
> 
> Despite their defeat, Zindar acknowledged your determination and provided his advice: never hold back in the jungle. WIth this advice ringing in your ears, you head towards...
> 
### Summary
Party got a quest to go to executioner's run at midnight to solve a small crime. Need to craft an encounter as to why.

Party also got hooked up by a mysterious stranger (said their name was summerwise, but it's totally xandala)

## Session 4 –  6/30/2024

*Previously, in Tomb of Annihilation...*

As you made your way through the lively streets of Port Nyanzaru, you passed a parade honoring Savras, the Lord of Divination. At The Thundering Lizard, the rowdy atmosphere drew you in, where you learned about Lawrence and his group's altercation. They had hired an untrustworthy guide named Salida before venturing into the jungle. Flasks of Wine and River Mist, two tabaxi brothers, offered their services as guides in exchange for 5 gold pieces per day or help in retrieving a lost family heirloom: a tiger mask in the lost city of Mezro.

Law was approached by a hooded figure, Summerwise, who revealed her quest for two pieces of a lost relic: a jewel hidden near Ataaz Muhahah and a ring worn by her father, Artus Cimber. She warned of the dangers posed by frost giants and red wizards in pursuit of Artus. Summerwise provided a sending stone for communication and offered supplies for the journey.

At Kaya's House of Repose, you discovered the innkeeper's distress over a stolen ledger. Following a trail of clues, you found muddy footprints, a map fragment, and a discarded cloak, pointing to an exchange at Executioner's Run. Confronting the cook, you learned of Jakarra, a former merchant's assistant turned petty criminal. To protect the cook, you staged a convincing fake attack, allowing him to hide at The Thundering Lizard.

Now, with just enough time to prepare, you head to Executioner's Run to confront Jakarra at midnight.

## Session 6 - 7/28/2024

*Previously, in Tomb of Annihilation*

>As the jungle mist settled over Port Nyanzaru, you continued your quest to unravel the mysteries of Chult. With Eku, your wise and enigmatic guide, you delved deeper into the city's secrets and the lore of the land.
>
>Your journey took you to the Temple of Oghma, where you met the venerable High Priest Hariz. There, you uncovered vital knowledge about the death curse—a vile affliction believed to originate from the lost city of Omu. This curse, tied to the dark artifact known as the Soulmonger, prevents the resurrection of the dead and causes those previously brought back to life to wither away. Hariz revealed that Omu, once a prosperous city, now lies hidden deep within Chult's jungles, surrounded by dangerous terrain and dense foliage, with clues pointing towards the Peaks of Flame and the Valley of Lost Honor.
>
>You also learned about the ancient cities of Mezro and Nangalore. Mezro, a once-holy city dedicated to Ubtao, is now a ruin filled with potential secrets and powerful artifacts. Nangalore, the decayed garden of the medusa queen Zalkoré, holds both danger and the promise of great discovery. High Priest Hariz cautioned you about the risks and rewards of exploring these enigmatic places.
>
>With this knowledge in hand, you sought passage to Fort Castiglar. After discussing your options with the harbormaster Zindar, you chose to join Wakanga O'Tamu's expedition. With writs of passage from the Zhentarim secured, you were ready to embark on the next leg of your journey.
>
>Tonight, you prepare to leave the safety of Port Nyanzaru, guided by Eku's wisdom, to face the unknown dangers of Chult. Your path will lead you through perilous jungles, ancient ruins, and possibly, to the heart of the death curse itself. As you step into the wild, you carry with you the hope of lifting this terrible curse and the knowledge that your actions may shape the fate of the entire land.

#### Dream Sequence for Law
As Law slips into a restless sleep, the gentle rocking of the ship is replaced by an oppressive darkness. In her dream, she stands in a dense jungle, the air thick with humidity and the distant sounds of unseen creatures. The scene shifts abruptly, and she finds herself in a dimly lit chamber, the air heavy with the smell of burning incense and damp stone.

Before her is a horrifying sight: her brother, Lawrence, bound to a stone altar. Lawrence, a stout dwarf druid known for wearing bearskins, looks gaunt and exhausted. His left eye is missing, replaced by an empty socket, and the left side of his face hangs slack, a result of a magical curse that left him with no muscle control on that side. Despite these disfigurements, his remaining eye burns with determination and pain.

Standing over him is Valindra, a lich whose face is shrouded in shadows beneath a deep hood. She holds a glowing, rune-inscribed whip in her skeletal hand, which she raises menacingly.

Valindra's voice is cold and echoing, "You know where the Shard of Night is, Lawrence. Tell me, and your suffering will end."

Lawrence, though weakened and battered, manages to lift his head slightly. His voice is hoarse but resolute. "You'll never get it from me, Valindra. The Shard is meant to destroy evil, not serve it."

Valindra's eyes flare with anger, and she strikes the whip across his chest, leaving a searing mark. Lawrence winces, but no sound escapes his lips. Valindra leans in closer, her voice a venomous whisper, "Your resistance is futile. The Shard of Night's power is within my grasp, and no disfigured druid can stop me."

Lawrence breathes heavily, struggling with the pain, but his gaze remains defiant. "The Shard... can destroy the Soulmonger. That's why you'll never have it."

Valindra's laugh is cold and hollow, filling the chamber with a chilling echo. "You think your courage will protect you? You are broken, Lawrence. Everyone breaks, eventually. The Shard will be mine, and when it is, your pain will be meaningless."

As Valindra raises the whip again, [Character's Name] tries to scream, to move, but finds herself paralyzed, unable to intervene. The scene around her blurs and darkens, the last image burned into her mind being her brother's anguished yet determined face.

She wakes with a start, her heart racing, the vision vivid and haunting. Lawrence is alive, but in great danger, being tortured for information about the Shard of Night—a powerful artifact capable of destroying the Soulmonger. The urgency of their quest is clear. They must find the Shard before Valindra does, rescue Lawrence, and end the death curse that plagues Chult.

This dream provides a vivid and personal impetus for the quest, highlighting Lawrence's courage and the dire situation he faces, while emphasizing the significance of the Shard of Night and the threat posed by Valindra.
### Session Notes
- had vision above, saw lawrence alive 
- learned about shard of night from Temple of Oghma
- Left boat for Fort Belaurian
- Kristal's character takes a piss off the wall and throws the bag of holding with Rokah inside it onto the ground from a large fall
- Ended with Rokah escaping the bag and lighting a building on fire

## Session 7 – 8/4/2024

*Previously, in Tomb of Annihilation...*

>The party whittled away their last days in civilization exploring the Grand Suq and the Temple District. After picking up a few odds and ends from the various market stalls, you went back to Kaya's House of Repose for one last night of comfort. 
> 
> In the night, Alishara received a vision from the god Ubtao. She saw her brother, Lawrence, being tortured by an unknown half elf who apparently calls herself "Xondala." She was searching for an artifact known as "the shard of night."
> 
>The next day the party visited the Temple of Oghma to see if anything was known about the shard of night. 
> 
>The party finally departed on a ship heading to Fort Castiglar. You managed to convince the captain to take a short 1-day detour to Fort Belaurian before exiting the bay.
> 
>Rokah, a Zhentarim spy searching for evidence of a relationship between the Flaming Fist and the infamous pirate bands of chult, met you outside the fort and asked you to help create a distraction. The allure of interdimensional smuggling being what it is, you decided to put Rokah inside the bag of holding as you approached the front gate directly. You were eventually brought before Commander Liara Porter when Rokah signalled he was running out of air and needed to get out of the bag (he tugged on a rope attached to Ali's belt). 
> 
>Chaos ensued, Ali made an excuse to go use the restroom. A guard explained that the latrines were a bad idea given the constant flooding, and escorted Ali to the wall to take care of business. In a panic, she threw the bag of holding from the ramparts to the ground, hearing a wet *crunch* as Rokah surely faceplanted.
> 
>Moments later, a building is engulfed in flames. Guards are shouting for help. WATER! SOME ONE FETCH SOME WATER TO DOUSE THE FLAMES!

### Session Notes
- kristal put out fire efficiently, won boon of teleportation if ship was gone
- PLayers get 200G from Rokah
- PLayers get teleported to Port Castigliar and everyone is dead. They proceed to dead check everyone via decapitation
- ghostly apparitions that don't appear hostile appear at the end

## Session 8 – 8/25/2024

*Previously, in Tomb of Annihilation...*

>In the last session, the party faced a series of intense challenges that tested their resolve and ingenuity. After a fire broke out in Fort Belaurian, Law quickly and efficiently extinguished the flames, earning a valuable boon of teleportation—an emergency escape route should their ship ever be compromised.
> 
>With an additional reward of 200 gold pieces from Rokah, the party decided to utilize the boon and teleport directly to the desolate and eerie Port Castigliar. Upon arrival, they were met with a grim sight: the entire area was littered with corpses, every living soul seemingly slain in a violent and mysterious attack.
> 
>Taking no chances, the party meticulously ensured that none of the bodies could rise again as undead, performing decapitations on each one. However, just as they completed this grim task, ghostly apparitions began to appear. These spectral figures, though unnerving, did not show any immediate hostility, leaving the party to ponder their intentions and the secrets they might hold.

### Session Notes
- Added a bit of lore; if someone fades away, they become a zombie
- Law impersonated Ubtao and gave food to a wandering traveler in the middle of the night.
	- This traveler became a convert to Ubtao and will evangelize his word and ways
	- His instructions are to tell Wakanga that Ubtao is back and also that Ubtao has left behind a relic called "the Shard of night" which can be wielded by the pure of heart to break the curse on this land
	- **NOTE: Maybe use this to allow Ubtao to rescue the party in a moment of dire need**
- Party learned that Eku serves/worships/likes Ubtao

## Session 9 - 9/1/2024
*Previously, in Tomb of Annihilation...*

> While the party made camp, one of the nightwatches noticed a wandering traveler heading towards you in the middle of the night. Law took this opportunity to impersonate a god, Ubtao, and convinced the traveler to become his apostle. You/Ubtao instructed the traveler to tell Wakanga that "Ubtao is back! And he has left a remnant of his favor in the Shard of Night, which can be wielded by the pure of heart to break the curse on this land."
> 
> You also learned that Eku is a worshiper of Ubtao, then broke camp for Mezro. There, you met a vision of Alisanda, who you learned was the wife of Artus Cimber. She gave you a coin and instructions to go to FireFinger to summon the shadow of Ras Nsi. If you can defeat this specter, you'd find the Amulet of Shadowbane, which will help to reveal the location of the shard of night.
> 
> Alisanda gave you a boon (you're now resistant to necrotic damage). You were then jumped by shadows. Roll initiative.

### Notes
- Players used channel divinity to make zombies retreat (ogres & Girallons)\
- Players short rested in Mezro
- Law wildshaped into an Almiraj and treid to impersonate I'Jin. She failed to convince guiard that she was I'Jin and then failed to convince them they broke some sort of curse.
- They met Captain Valeria Sorn and agreed to call Commander Liara on the sending stone in the morning
- Add Tiger Mask to Moroder's inventory
- Tzindelor assaults their camp and kills most of the guards
- Breath weapon unleashed, decimated a few players. Saved by a coatl that transformed into a large gold dragon

## Session 10 - 9/8/2024

*Previously, in Tomb of Annihilation...*

>In the dead of night, the party stumbled upon a **Flaming Fist patrol** deep within the overgrown jungle outside Mezro. With tensions high and darkness obscuring intentions, Law decided to take a creative approach—wildshaping into an **almiraj**, the sacred form of the trickster god I’jin. However, her attempts to convince the patrol of her divine presence didn’t go as planned, leading to an awkward standoff. But, through clever negotiation and charm, they managed to win over the trust of **Captain Valeria Sorn**, agreeing to contact **Commander Liara Portyr** via Sending Stone at dawn to solidify their tenuous alliance and provide her an update.
>
>Their rest in the ruined city was short-lived, as they soon found themselves under assault by the fearsome **red dragon Tzindelor**, who tore through the camp with fire and fury, decimating the  guards. Just when all hope seemed lost, the celestial form of a Coautl expanded into the image of a **golden dragon**, radiating power and light, forcing Tzindelor to retreat into the night skies.
>
>Bruised and battered, the party took stock of their situation, adding the **Tiger Mask** to Moroder's inventory. With dawn breaking over the ruins of Mezro, they prepare to face new dangers, including the possibility of a perilous climb up Firefinger to seek out the **Amulet of Shadowbane**.
