> Discuss manual challenges
> Identify priorities

- Hillel doesn't have a specific ask
- "Why are we selling small deals that qualify for Tech Touch?"
	- Reason we tell ourselves we want live training is because we don't offer anything else for this cohort.
- Help Center
	- There's no point of view for how we would educate someone via the Help Center. "The help center is not very helpful."
	- Need help to make it easier to find content, layout more user friendly, etc.
- Issues with how we commission tech touch that shouldn't be
- Pendo-like guides  
- Usage data in improving on-boarding experience
-
