The Super Bowl was yesterday and I felt/feel like shit. I guess that's a good thing; it means my diet and habits are improving to the point that overindulgences have a natural incentive to avoid. 

I'm interviewing for a new role this week (hopefully). The company is called MuckRack. The position is pretty much what I've done at SeekOut, but the twist is doing it as an IC.
