Onboarding series: what a CSM would send to a customer during onboarding
- Planned launch date 1/1/2024
- Content
	- Welcome
	- How to activate account
	- Training resources
	- Seekout 101, 201, 301 specific
	- Invite to open sourcing session
	- Introduce diversity training
	- GitHub and Expert training (depending on SKU, Cass unsure how new SKUs will impact that and what people will have)
- How they send:
	- batched at a specified cadence *unless* they've already done the training
- Success Metric: not finalized, but looking at registration & attendance and usage data. 
	- i.e. of people that attended 101, what does usage look like compared to those that didn't?

ChurnZero is text-based. Goal is for the emails to appear to be written by a person 1:1
