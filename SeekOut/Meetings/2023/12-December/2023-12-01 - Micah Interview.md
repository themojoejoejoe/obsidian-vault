LOVE his energy, but results/evidence are thin

- **Tell me about a time when you didn't know what to do next or how to solve a challenging problem.** How do you learn what you don't know? What were the options you considered? How did you decide the best path forward? What was the outcome.

Mainly began working in native advertising and graduated into email marketing. Moved into a management role where he currently.

Starting to install GTM on their website. How does it work, how do they tag things and understand what actions are occuring on their website. At the time he didn't have the foundational knowledge about how to set this up. Approach is dive in and see what he can learn. Continued to experiment and google. Strong bias for self-service and asking questions of any internal resources.

Got tag manager installed and then was able to show where revenue was coming from. This helped him make recommendations about what was performing and what wasn't and he recommended putting more investment in Facebook because tehy were seeing it move people to the next spending tier. Generated +4.8% ROI lift in the website channel. 12M - 24M channel.

* **Tell me about the most exciting automated lifecycle nurture you've worked on.** What made it exciting? What was the goal? What was the result?

Set up an automated email based on what functionality people could access. Some of that functionality was greyed out - customers didn't have access to it. He was able to see user behavior that was unavailable to them, and then created an email program that could react to those actions and send a campaign to try for an upsell. 

No results because he was more junior. Some doubts as to what he did versus what others decided and he executed.

- **When it comes to measuring the effectiveness of email campaigns, what key performance indicators (KPIs) do you consider most important, and why?** How do you interpret and act on the data from these metrics to optimize future campaigns?

It depends. What am I trying to achieve with this email? Sometimes it's clicks. Sometimes it's responses (like replies). One of the key things that is overlooked is "what is the goal of this email campaign and what are we doing to reach this goal?" Sometimes it's open rate, sometimes it's form conversions (i.e. X% form fills on registration)


- **In terms of marketing automation, can you share an example of how you've leveraged it to personalize and target email communications for different audience segments?** What kind of personalization strategies have you found most effective?

Coding in salutations based on who people are. He's used Zapier to assemble emails to determine which books we'd use for "weekly sale." So he'd look at which were viewed the most over the past month and then pull them into an email if they were on sale. Result: that program generated between $50 and $75K.  

Free book of the month was converting at 35% and he was able to turn this into a signifcant revenue driver.

He was the idea person, someone else did the work.

Didn't really understand the term "segmentation" - strong concern his email experience is not at the level we need for someone in this role to balance strategy & execution.

- **When faced with multiple marketing initiatives and limited resources, how do you prioritize which projects to focus on?** Can you describe your approach to balancing short-term and long-term goals?

Prioritizes based on notes that are categorized by 4 levels - scope, investment, impact. He then works with his manager to confirm his prioritization is correct with his manager. Good response.


*** 

- **Describe a time when someone on your team challenged you to think differently about a problem.** What was the situation? How did you respond? What was the outcome?

Steph helped her reframe a concern about her role/scope as an opportunity to learn. Note: I didn't actually ask this question, it came up organically in the midst of another response.

Organizes by priority and impact.

- **Tell me about a time when you realized you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well.** What did you do about it? What was the outcome? Is there anything you'd have done differently?
