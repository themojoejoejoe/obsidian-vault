- **Tell me about a time when you didn't know what to do next or how to solve a challenging problem.** How do you learn what you don't know? What were the options you considered? How did you decide the best path forward? What was the outcome.

Limeade - Had challenge of understanding what was happening in the middle of the sales funnel. Molly started a process to audit who was sending what - sales cycle of ~12 months. Had no data. She determined she needed to convince marketing & sales that marketing needs to care about the sales funnel as well. 

Molly then used Salesloft to help optimize nurtures for Sales. She optimized these emails to craft content for these. Customer engagement with the emails established trust with Sales.

This then enabled her to set up similar things in Marketo that she could automate more. Now with the trust of sales, they shifted the work her way. It started as a nurture stream based on persona, then expanded to multiple products across multiple personas. 

This eventually led to a welcome stream that pushed people into specific topical streams based on engagement. 

*Did that have an effect on velocity or conversion rate?*
Systems weren't set up well enough to understand conversion rate, but velocity improved from 155 days to 57 days.

* **Tell me about the most exciting automated lifecycle nurture you've worked on.** What made it exciting? What was the goal? What was the result?


- **When it comes to measuring the effectiveness of email campaigns, what key performance indicators (KPIs) do you consider most important, and why?** How do you interpret and act on the data from these metrics to optimize future campaigns?

In the past, open rates, unsub rates, CTR, "engagement minutes" (tracked via DemandBase). Open rates are more deprioritized, so CTR & unsub rates are the most important metrics to look at. 

*Have you ever had pipeline targets for an email campaign?*

Not really. Primarily because Limeade's win rate was 6% and velocity was so slow, her goals were more placed within the realm of things she could control. By virtue of her programs (and a lot of other things), Limeade improved winrate from 6% to 14%.


- **In terms of marketing automation, can you share an example of how you've leveraged it to personalize and target email communications for different audience segments?** What kind of personalization strategies have you found most effective?

One of the things they were implementing at Limeade was a get in touch stream. Based on ABM strategy, she was tasked with understanding how to differentiate "whales" from other accounts. Goal of this stream was to push people to a demo. "How can we get in touch with Whales differently? What sorts of extra investment could we do to optimize." So she partnered with PFL to incorporate a direct mail strategy within the email stream. Triggered the direct mail based on behavior with stream. If they didn't book a demo based on that direct mail campaign, they would offer time to do a high touch "strategy session" with the person to provide more white glove support.

*What other teams/departments did you partner with, and how did you get them to prioritize that work?*

Met regularly with crossfunctional partners and C-Suiite to collaborate on what they could they could try and what they could do. Throwing things at a wall, but everyone was involved from the jump.

- **When faced with multiple marketing initiatives and limited resources, how do you prioritize which projects to focus on?** Can you describe your approach to balancing short-term and long-term goals?

*** 

- **Describe a time when someone on your team challenged you to think differently about a problem.** What was the situation? How did you respond? What was the outcome?

Steph helped her reframe a concern about her role/scope as an opportunity to learn. Note: I didn't actually ask this question, it came up organically in the midst of another response.


- **Tell me about a time when you realized you needed a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well.** What did you do about it? What was the outcome? Is there anything you'd have done differently?



@joe
 these are great examples for your "curious" focus, i especially like the 2nd one. if you want to include one of those with a few specific questions to assess their functional expertise that would be perfect.
the functional areas Laura and I mapped for you are:
- Email one-off and program execution, automation, measurement
- Automation platform usage
- Prioritization, use of data to inform initiatives and roadmap
