- Purpose: to help maintain alignment and stay/get "unstuck"
- Big topic today: [reviewing R&Rs](https://zipstorm.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/MarketingTeamSite/EbXRLoqb83NCrs4moZz4ktUB8ERns3i28teL1zRkGP94yw?e=TdZlUE&wdLOR=c600E16F9-71E8-224A-AF01-BAE213D5B887)
- **Need to have a deeper RACI - we have accountable on this sheet, but not responsible, consulted, or informed.**
- Crisis Comms - Lindsay to work with Sam Shaddox prior to his pat leave to identify current lay of the land (new agency?) and process moving forward.
- Somya pointed out we don't have an SME input function informing GTM efforts. Group agrees that's an important lens to add to this to clarify ownership.
- Competitive Intelligence
	- Chris: "everyone owns CI"
	- Ownership definition needs to be articulated in a specific artifact/outcome
	- Anything Grow-related, Somya needs to be involved in
- Customer Insights & Feedback
	- Customer Success Accountable overall, supported by marketing, PMM, etc.
	- Bryce: We need a centralized customer experience program. Whose job is it to gather proactive customer feedback? Run surveys? Tell the story of the overall customer experience?
- Pricing & Packaging
	- PMM Accountable for developing pricing strategies & models
- Product Marketing
	- Develop product strategy & roadmap
	- Somya needs to be involved/leading anything related to Grow
	-
