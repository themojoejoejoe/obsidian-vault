## Sales
- Commercial & Enterprise are now combined. Landon and Dan have sellers that do both
- Need to automate demo requests for companies under 500 employees

## CS
- Bryce: *For CS, We must change the playbook**
	 - JoJo to take on TechTouch
	 - Other CSMs to focus on High Touch
		 - Was $25K+, now going to be $40K+
	 - Need to figure out how to scale
		 - Education
		 - Adoption
		 - Support
 - Marketing & GTM *not* supporting further developing SMB self-service project, but will support how we use the structure to drive more automation and enablement for smaller company sizes (TechTouch?)
 - CSMs will have 20-25 renewals each for remainder of year
 - Need to identify owner for Help Center Content

## Marketing
- 10 Events remaining for year - work that *has* to be done
- Analytics needs - Howard Becker is the primary POC
- Design - limited resources, need to cut requests early and align with Tallon on delivery
