- Gated form can be on front or back end of experience
- SentinelOne -viewable branching demos
- Can blur/obfuscate information as needed
- Build demo via Chrome Extenstion - either recording screenshot or recording HTML
- Can incorporate video (i.e. talking heads) and voice overs
- Can add dynamic content (i.e. images, text, etc.) for personalization. Could also anonymize actual search results with fake names
- For Marketo integration, would require "Growth" package 
	- $100/user/month, minimum 5 users
		- $6K/year
		- Enterprise starts at $12K
- can segment the experience for different experiences/features
- UTM params are captured as normal
- Analytics are more advanced than Navattic
	- Can see % of demo completed and a handful of other basic usage fields
- Offers chatbot integration support
- Can configure events for GA
- Contrasting with Arcade:
	- Storylane has both HTML & screen recording - 
	- No Marketo integration with Arcade
- Contrasting with Navattic:
	- Anecdotal feedback that Navattic is more complex
