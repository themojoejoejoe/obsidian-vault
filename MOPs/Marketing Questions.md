The below represents a basic primer of questions Marketing is typically accountable for answering. It is not intended to be comprehensive, but generally provides a solid foundation of reports useful to most organizations.

>[!Quote] Start with WHY
>You have to understand the "Why" of the question before you can move onto anything else. answering the way saves you insane amounts of time going back and forth.
>>- Why do you need an opportunities report? Oh you actually are wanting to answer a question about closed lost deals over the past 90 days. **WHY** are you wanting to see that?
>>- Why do you want to do which MQLs are performing badly? Oh because you're not taking action on it you just want to know... back of the line you go!
>
>Search for the problem BEFORE searching for the data to solve the problem. Doing it the other way around can limit the answers/solutions you find. Let the business processes/questions determine the reporting cadence. Don't do unnecessary work like pulling numbers daily only to have something reviewed weekly.
