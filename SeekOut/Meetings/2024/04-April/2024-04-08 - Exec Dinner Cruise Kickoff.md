**Date:** 5/23/2024

**Use-case:** about bids, proposals, and staffing

**Audience:** primarily to A&D but appropriate to broader audience (ABM list for Grow)

**Theme:** double down on Grow

**Goal:** 40 attendees on-boat
* Targeting 60 accounts of the 140 ABM list
* Ideally no more than 2 people per account attend
* *Can* fit 60-80 people on boat if needs must but want to keep it around 40 for the intimate/exclusive vibes
* *Need ~75 people registered to hit the goal*
