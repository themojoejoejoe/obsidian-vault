- Strengthening Sales Org
	- SPIF: Monthly leaderboard, incentivized, for salesperson with most pipe created (NB & Exp)
		- Weekly publishing of leaders to drive competition and visibility, share wins
	- Kristen: we're going to be starting a "Win Announcement" process that shares information and context about what's working, who was involved, and general knowledge transfer among sellers. The intent is for this to be fully automated.

- Sam questions:
	- to Kristen: "How would you use Anoop in Q3 & Q4?"
		- Tapping into his network for customer engagement
		- Leverage him more mid-to-late in the sales process
			- i.e. Meeting 3 or 4 "hey you want to meet Anoop? He can show you XYZ"
	- to Steph: "How would you use Anoop in Q3 & Q4?"
		- "I would love to figure out how to get Lazslo Bock more involved, as well as 2 or 3 people that are like him to be advocates and open doors for us."
		- People buy because they believe what you believe. We need to be more crisp on what we believe so that we attract more. If that's Anoop being that, great. But sometimes it's someone else. At Limeade, it was our CHRO who was our chief evangelist.
- Leveraging Advocates
	- Eric Miller from Paramount - is there something we can do with his story or the workflow he's described that we can make his strategy more repeatable. How he's structured his team, how he's achieved the results he has. 
		- likely can't speak directly on SeekOut's behalf but we could leverage his story generically as a thought leadership piece (anonymized)
	- Raytheon Global head of TA has said SeekOut is great for sourcing cleared talent and essential for Raytheon. *There's a short-term opportunity for driving expansion related to cleared talent*
	- Steph asked exec recruiter from Cleared Talent (Benjamin Meena - has a top-ranking SEO post for "ultimate tools list for finding cleared professionals")
- PLG-lite Efforts
	- Calculator or Reports we could allow users to experience some level of value (relies a bit on imagination versus a full on PLG experience, but a step in that direction)
	- Automated transactions for a limited number of SKUs
- "What can we do to make your lives simpler?" (Sam to Kristen & Steph)
	- Kristen: 
		- More enterprise sellers
		- Improve how we do demos. Introduce more consistency
		- For Grow, have more of our sellers take the first meetings and pull in Claire/Anoop on subsequent meetings
		- Improving Win Rates
			- Having AMs form relationships with more senior echelons of customer accounts. Need multiple connection points at all levels of the account.
		- Potential "re-Launch" for Grow
			- Stephanie: I have an idea that we have "a moment" March 11-13 in Las Vegas at Transform where we have a marquee customer on stage, a large booth, and a stage in our booth about how Grow has been a successful Talent Management tool at their organization
				- Could possibly work for Salesforce or Atlassian. Accenture, WiPro, DSC, CreditKarma - good companies in pipe but still early stage

	- Improve Lead Generation Capabilities on our website

## Breakout 3

Attendees: Ed Pedini, Hitesh Mulani, Spencer Czpezski

- Hitesh: "We're not going to triple MQL volume in the next 2 quarters. So how do we do more white glove handling of the things we're getting?"
	- Every opportunity needs to be reviewed by owner and their manager before the meeting (deck, agenda, next steps, etc.)
	- Accountability for Managers to follow up with sales owner
	- Assign executive sponsor to enterprise deals
- Expand SDR capabilities for outbounding via 3P agency
- Build muscle on "land & expand" - how do we get a few more licenses at larger companies?
- "Awareness Campaign"
	- Previously CS would find an organization with relatively low utilization. They would then meet with TA leaders to discuss ROI and say "you don't really know who else in your organization may benefit from SeekOut. Why don't before your renewal, we figure out what makes sense?"
		- Would get recruiters together, give them licenses for 30/60/90 days
		- At the end of that period, we review usage and determine how many licenses you actually need.
		- Incentivize with swag
		- Drive better relationships with senior executives by requiring executive sponsor
- Understand why things are stuck in SAL
- Marketing support for Tech Touch (smaller business accounts)
	- customer marketing, invite to demos to see (new feature)
- Customer Promo to buy X licenses for discounted offer
- Ed: We should sell more sourcing seats for rediscovery than anything else
- Can we augment our database using SeekOut?

### Breakout 3 Summary
>Hitesh emphasized focusing on white-glove handling of existing opportunities because of the impracticalities of tripling MQL volume. Plans included thorough opportunity reviews, executive sponsors for enterprise deals, and expanding SDR capabilities. They aimed to drive growth through the "land & expand" strategy, an "Awareness Campaign" for low utilization organizations, and marketing support for smaller business accounts. Additionally, a customer promo for discounted licenses and selling more sourcing seats for rediscovery were proposed.
