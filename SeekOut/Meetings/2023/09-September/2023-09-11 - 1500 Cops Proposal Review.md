COPs Proposals

## Background

The Marketing Operations team is spending more time and energy on campaign execution and QA review than we were originally scoped to support, which is edging us towards burnout situations and distracting us from prioritizing our other goals. To address this concern proactively, Victoria is drafting a "t-shirt sizing" proposal for how we can facilitate campaign operations more scalably at SeekOut.  
The approximate buckets or "sizes" of this proposal will be:  

1. Small: Proposal with current resources, no incremental investment
2. Medium: Proposal for some incremental resources/spend
3. Large: Proposal for long-term internal campaign operations team

## **Step 1: Maketo Email Program Definition**

Defining the scope of the build work will help streamline our process.  
**Small  
**Straight forward audience with little to no change on the email.  
_Example: Follow-up emails_  
  
**Medium**  
Somewhat straight forward audience targeting criteria, relatively simple email that may or may not require custom design work.  
Require net new landing page work  
_Example: Newsletters, webinar invite_  
  
**Large**  
Any programs that are evergreen, complex by nature, or are considered high visibility  
_Example: new email series, tier 1 product release_  
  

## **Step 2: Need to implement regardless of sizing options below**

- Every medium and large size programs must use a campaign brief.

- We only have a basic email campaign brief right now that’s not used consistently.
- Can develop additional ones to meet the needs of the work (i.e. email + LP)

- Follow SLA’s (tbd: 1 week for basic build requests / 3 days for QA)

  
**For the small & medium COPS proposal below, the following is recommended.**  

- Growth team members are aligned by lifecycle - acquisition, onboarding, expansion, ABM..etc. They are responsible for building programs within their lifecycle.
- All builds are done within growth team, can be QA’d b/t the team members that are eligible to do so. If a growth team member is both builder and bar raiser, they can have MOPs QA their work.
- Can we have an incentive to become a bar raiser?

  

## Step 3: COPS proposal

  
**Small (no new rescues)**  

- +1 bar raisers (certification / MOPs approval)
- +1 builder for events/ABM
- MOPs will only bar raise for Large size builds / require MOPs sign off on the campaign brief level before build

  
**Medium  
**  

- Same model as above
- +1 dedicated bar raiser - fte / contractor / agency
- MOPs will act mainly as a consultant during program scope / continues to build and manage operational/data programs.

  
**Large (New team structure / workflow)**  
This is a quite different proposal than the Small and Medium sizes. Growth team members will continue to align to their lifecycle stages, except they will not do any building in Marketo.  

- +2 Dedicate campaign operation specialist that build across lifecycles and QA each other’s work.
- Growth marketing team members will work directly with the dedicated resources to build, bar raise, and launch.
- MOPs will act mainly as a consultant during program scope

> [!todo] Action Items

We reviewed the first draft of the proposal [here](https://seekout-hq.slack.com/docs/T0JCW75GQ/F05R3329PJN). For next steps, Victoria is sizing the various request types to time ranges (e.g. 2-3 hours, 4-8 hours, etc.) and reviewing campaigns from the last quarter as a means of estimating our future needs.

We think we may be able to solve our resourcing channels internally with the right changes, but the rough options are essentially (in our order of preference):

1. We modify roles/responsibilities to facilitate a decentralized execution/bar raising model
    
2. We create a new FTE to support centralized campaign operations
    
3. We outsource execution to an agency and maintain bar raising internally.
    

  

We think Bar Raising is overly difficult and potentially risky to outsource because a consultant would only be able to conduct a technical review. They would not have a deep enough understanding of SeekOut or the HR Tech space to provide qualitative review.
