- Need to have a call back into admin to say "send us the approved link"
- Website messaging needs to be along the lines of "see if you qualify"
- VM: do we need approve & deny lists?
	- Ed: Yes
	- Laura: how do we manage updates to the approve list to ensure companies are still under 100 employees?
	- Prijoe to make a new white list every X months
	- If someone is on the blacklist but not on the white list, Marketo makes the determining choice
	- Add competitor domains to form suppression

Admin checks whitelist and number of accounts and blacklist of freedomains
* Whitelist is static (updated by Prijoe manually)
* Configurable blacklist lives in Marketo (competitors)
* Marketo form will pass admin all info about record to populate fields later
